<h2 id="FOREWORD">FOREWORD</h2>

<p>In this volume will be found a series of
articles which in recent years have appeared
in <i>Forest and Stream</i>. The incidents recounted
took place in widely separated parts of the
United States and Canada.</p>

<p>As time slips by there is a pleasure in
recalling hunting exploits which have become
relegated to a past that can be lived over
again only in memory. Whoever feels the
sportsman’s ardor kindle when blood red
tales of the hunt are related&mdash;an ardor which
the camera enthusiast, who possesses merely
a platonic love of sport cannot appreciate&mdash;may
discover an excuse for this book. Its
style may strike one as somewhat informal
and lacking in literary finish, but it should be
borne in mind that too much formality is
likely to take away the charm of camp life.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">iv</span></p>

<p>If you picture yourself seated on a log by
the open camp-fire you will not be apt to
criticize the absence of polish in the composition
of the text. You would as soon ask your
guide to substitute patent leather shoes for
his greased boots.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">In the</span> fall of 1896 I decided upon taking
a hunting trip to the White River country
in Colorado. At that time the White River
country was well supplied with game and
might almost be considered a sportsman’s
paradise, or, as an Indian described it to me,
like the “happy hunting grounds.” Deer
were very plentiful, and around Hayden and
in California Park antelope were numerous,
although very shy. Bull elk occasionally
adorned the landscape with their imposing
presence and splendid spread of antlers. The
cougar was heard occasionally, although never
seen unless hunted with dogs. Old “Silver
Tip” frequented the neighborhood, but had
a way of making his bulky form vanish like
some apparition. His depredations, where
he had mangled the carcass of some animal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
or disturbed the habitations of a lot of small
fry under a rotten log, furnished evidence of
his presence. There was enough large game
in the country to give some idea of what it had
been at a time when the Redskin was the
undisputed proprietor of the soil.</p>

<p>I had secured, through correspondence, the
services of a guide who had been well recommended.
Having heard considerably about
the cowboy, my curiosity had been somewhat
excited, and I desired to form a better acquaintance
from actual experience. The West
was then, to my mind, a geographical
area possessing a certain wildness and wooliness,
which my imagination pictured to me.
The rapid trend of events makes a book
describing its general conditions seem behind
the times almost as soon as it is published.
Much of what I had read and heard, however,
seemed to me like a fairy tale in the face
of actual experience, although, allowing for
exaggeration, back of it all it had a foundation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
of facts. Every time I have visited the
West I have noticed the rapid progress of
change.</p>

<p>During my first hunting experience, I
noticed that the typical bad man, of whom I
had heard so much, with his rough-and-ready
manner, accoutred with dangerous weapons,
his social position established by the size of
his private graveyard, was wanting. The
facetious desperado, who had a pleasant way
of requesting the “tenderfoot” to dance while
he marked time with his six-shooter, was “non
est.” An unappreciative community had organized
from time to time a few “necktie
parties,” and the experience of such gentlemen
has since become an interesting theme
for romance. The large settled communities
of course had the same cosmopolitan air and
character that one finds in the East. There
was, nevertheless, something in the social
atmosphere which impressed you with the
feeling that everything was very different.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
The cowboy, of whom I had heard so much, I
learned to recognize as generally a very quiet,
civil person, never going out of his way to do
extraordinary things nor to make himself conspicuous.
A man of few words and not inclined
to familiarity, he is essentially a man
of action, and prefers to take a short cut
to accomplish his purpose. If one should
conclude that his reserve and his reticence
were the result of mental torpor, he would
make a great mistake. Apparently taking
little interest in a new acquaintance, and seeming
to lack ordinary curiosity, I find that he
is, notwithstanding, a very close observer and
has a quiet way of extracting information
without appearing eager to do so.</p>

<p>My guide engaged to meet me at Buford,
Colo. Being unacquainted with the locality,
I wrote to obtain information concerning the
railroad station nearest my destination, and
learned that it was Rifle. When I arrived at
Rifle, I inquired about the best way to get
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
to Buford, and was informed, to my surprise,
that I had a journey by wagon of sixty
miles to make. This was my first experience
with the magnificent distances of the West.
The result was that I miscalculated the time
of meeting my guide by an entire day. When
I arrived at Buford on the evening of the next
day, my guide, whom I saw for the first time,
rode up on a mustang, seated in a big Mexican
saddle. With an easy air, as though we had
been acquainted all our lives, he expressed
his pleasure at meeting me and advised all
necessary arrangements for the morrow’s start
on our hunt back in the mountains.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">PACKING A BRONCHO.</p>

<p class="caption">Blindfolding a vicious animal is an expedient that generally
attains its purpose.</p></div>

<p>It is interesting to notice how quickly and
skillfully an experienced man can pack a lot
of horses, apportioning the loads with great
fairness, and balancing the dead weight so
that it will ride easily on the backs of the not
overwilling animals. Packing seems easy, and
if you want to know how easy it is, try it.
After you have ridden a mile or so, perhaps,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
some critical beast will begin to subject your
work to a severe test by bucking. To express
the state of your feelings when this happens
would be impossible, unless your sympathetic
guide, who is generally an expert in swearing,
can help you out.</p>

<p>The first day’s journey was rather long and
tedious, a large part of it through monotonous
stretches of sage brush. When at length
the timber was reached, the change was most
agreeable. We arrived at the location of our
first camp without a mishap, unless having my
legs squeezed between the horse and a tree a
couple of times could be considered as such.
Although my guide knew his business as a
guide, I could not recommend him as a first-rate
cook. His efforts at making bread proved
a flat failure, and we had to do without the
staff of life. The canned provisions, which
required practically no skill in their preparation,
made the inefficiency of the cooking less
apparent.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>

<p>The camp being pitched in a well timbered
and picturesque spot, we spent the rest of the
afternoon in arranging everything and laying
our plans for the next day. The waning sunlight
found us spread comfortably around a
big camp-fire, which sent its genial glow far
into the dark recesses of the gloomy forest.
When a great heap of burning faggots had
sunk into a bed of smouldering ashes and the
rising wind murmuring through the pines
gave warning of an approaching storm, I
concluded to crawl under the bedding and
sleep. The hard, frozen ground is not as
comfortable as a spring mattress, but I had
to get used to it, and was sleeping soundly,
when I was awakened in the morning by the
cheerful voice of the guide, who called out,
“Breakfast!” as if he were summoning all the
guests of a boarding house to a feast. When
I crawled out of my sleeping bag into the
chilly atmosphere, I found the guide doing
the chores in his stocking feet. A few dashes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
of ice-cold water from the stream hard by
drove away all feeling of drowsiness, and
made me conscious of the fact that I had an
appetite.</p>

<p>After breakfast, without waiting to put
camp in order, for the morning was already
advanced, we started out in search of game.
On coming to the edge of the timber, where
the country opened up into one of the little
parks which we frequently found in that
locality, I saw the tall form of my guide
slowly stoop behind some bushes, while, at
the same time, he motioned me to be cautious.
I soon saw what had arrested his attention. A
magnificent blacktail deer, with a fine set of
antlers, stood out in full view, not more than
a hundred yards away. There were a half a
dozen does nearby, but they did not interest
me. I brought “Old Meat in the Pot” to my
shoulders, for that is what my guide had
christened my .45-90, and after taking deliberate
aim, fired. Which was the most astonished,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
the buck, or myself, I could not say.
He stood perfectly motionless, like an image
in bronze. I had evidently missed him. A
second shot fared the same; then the whole
bunch of deer began to scamper off unharmed
by any of the shots I had fired at the buck.
I could not account for the bad marksmanship,
for I knew that I did not have the buck
fever. The guide said that I had killed one
of the deer, which I disputed, until he pointed
to a dying animal lying in a dense thicket just
to the rear of the deer that had served as my
target. I had not even seen it, until it was
pointed out to me after I had shot it. After
making several experiments with the rifle without
satisfactory results, I found that the sight
had been knocked out of place. I then handed
the rifle over to the guide without correcting
the error and requested him to let me see how
a cowboy could shoot. With evident pride
in his skill he brought the gun to his shoulder,
but he shot as badly as any tenderfoot.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>

<p>In the meantime, the air was full of sounds
more terrible than the report of the rifle. Any
one who has heard a cowboy swear when he
is really in earnest can understand what I
mean.</p>

<p>At last it occurred to him that the sights
might be out of order, and when he examined
them and discovered the trouble, he looked
at me, and seeing my complacent smile, the
whole truth dawned upon him. We both
laughed heartily at our mutual discomfiture
and pledged each other’s health from the flask
to celebrate the occasion.</p>

<p>I returned to the camp without a trophy to
commemorate my first success in killing deer,
although I had secured an abundant supply
of meat.</p>

<p>The next day we covered considerable
ground on horseback, without success. I had,
however, an interesting experience in climbing
a mountain known as Old Sleepy Cap, sometimes,
because of its peculiar formation at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
the summit, called the Razor Back. The
ascent of this mountain was not particularly
easy, on account of its abrupt elevation,
although the height above the surrounding
country was not great. The formation at
the summit, which gave the unpoetical name
of Razor Back to the mass, consisted of a
long, narrow ridge, not more than eighteen
inches to two feet in width, bristling with
sharp projections of rock of quite uniform
height extending nearly its entire length of
about ninety yards. At each end it broadens
out in a space conveniently large for a temporary
resting place. After satisfying my
curiosity, I suggested a descent into the valley,
where the cool atmosphere would afford a welcome
relief from the blazing rays of the sun.
Much to my surprise, the guide informed me
that the ascent was much easier at the point
we came up than the descent, unless I wished
to reach the bottom in a fashion that would
imperil my neck. After discussing the matter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
with him a few moments and carefully studying
the position, I came to the conclusion that
he was right. We observed that at the other
end we could find an easy way to descend.
That meant a rather long and disagreeable
walk on the serrated ridge, attended with considerable
danger, or a still more unpleasant
experience if I should attempt to crawl on
hands and knees for greater safety. Like
a couple of tomcat serenaders promenading
on the top of a brick wall liberally strewn
with broken bottles, we crawled to the far
end of the ridge, where, with some difficulty,
we descended. We returned to camp with no
better luck than securing a snowshoe rabbit,
which I shot through the head.</p>

<p>For some days I conscientiously hunted, but
found it difficult to come close enough to get a
good shot at deer. I saw quite a number
bounding away far out of range, often stopping
at a safe distance to observe our movements.
For lack of better sport, I occasionally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
practiced on the “fool grouse”&mdash;a
bird very similar in appearance to our Eastern
partridge, but about the tamest game I have
ever shot. I could generally have three trials
at one before it would move. I would pace
off the proper space, and then aim at the head.
The flesh was not particularly delicate, and
would certainly not please the palate of an
epicure.</p>

<p>One day as we were traveling in a blinding
snow flurry, we came to a precipice thickly
fringed with undergrowth and small trees.
Impelled by curiosity, I got off my horse and
went near the edge to get a view of the country
below. The waving tops of the pines
beneath were barely visible, the force of the
wind coming through the great long valley
at my feet, sounded like the hollow roar of
the ocean. As I stood upon the cliff, gratifying
my fancy with the weird and strange impressions
the surroundings made upon me,
the storm began to abate, and through the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
diminishing fall of snow the sun gradually
diffused its light, and presently the atmosphere
cleared up, and the entire landscape was
revealed to view as though a great white sheet
concealing nature’s panorama had been pulled
aside. On a ledge jutting out from the base
of the precipice, about two hundred feet below,
I observed the shapely form of a deer
with a fawn lying on the rock alongside of it.
As far as the eye could distinguish, a great
forest of aspen with white trunks and branches
sparsely decorated with yellow leaves, filled
the valley. Dense masses of pines, which
completely covered the steep mountain sides,
except where the ragged projections broke
through, formed a dark setting to the brilliant
landscape which lay between. My reverie
was finally broken by a voice nearby: “Well,
pardner, it’s pretty late and we are a long
way from camp.” Traveling in that rough
country after dark is not attractive to one who
is not looking for trouble. So I mounted my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
horse and began to occupy myself with observing
game signs and incidentally thought
of the camp-fire and kettle.</p>

<p>It is interesting to notice how strangely the
element of luck will enter into a sportsman’s
experience. One day, after hunting faithfully
from early dawn until evening without success,
I concluded to vary the monotony by
shooting at a mark. I had not been engaged
in that pastime very long before my attention
was arrested by hearing something crashing
through the brush at the foot of the hill where
I stood, and presently I saw a fine blacktail
buck come bounding up the slope directly
toward me, accompanied by a doe. My rifle
was just ready to bring up to my shoulder, but
I remained motionless in plain view, waiting
for the game to come within easy range. A
more picturesque sight than that blacktail,
easily and gracefully clearing the fallen timbers,
I have rarely seen. My eagerness did
not interfere with my sizing up the well-proportioned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
and beautifully poised antlers,
which I regarded as already mine. As I
raised my rifle to shoot, although the action
was quite deliberate, it was immediately
noticed. The deer changed its course when
not over forty yards away, exposing its broad
flank to my aim. It ran some distance after
I fired, clearing with ease the trunk of a large
fallen tree, and giving me no little concern
for a few moments. Following his tracks, I
soon came upon the deer, dead. It was indeed
a fine specimen, weighing perhaps two
hundred and fifty pounds, in good condition
and with a perfect set of antlers.</p>

<p>I had often heard of the remarkably acute
senses of wild animals; the timidity and keenness
of deer are proverbial, and yet here was
an instance which seemed to belie all former
stories and past experience. Standing in plain
view while firing at a mark, the buck ran
directly toward me. One would naturally
suppose that the noise of the shooting would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
have driven the animal away. My theory
about the occurrence is, that when the report
of the rifle is first heard, the tendency is for
a wild animal to become alarmed and run in
the opposite direction, but presently when it
catches the echo, the real direction of the
sound is misconceived, and it will then run
in the direction of the firing. Other sportsmen
have agreed with me in this view.
There is no doubt that deer and other wild
animals can tell the direction of sound, and
consequently, when one becomes alarmed by
the shooting and runs toward the place where
the sportsman is located, it is not the ear, but
the judgment that is at fault. A wild animal
can have no correct idea of an echo, but undoubtedly
imagines that it is an entirely different
sound, and being last heard determines
its final course.</p>

<p>This, however, does not explain the action
of the deer in running directly toward me
when I was in plain view. All sportsmen soon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
learn to recognize the fact that animals,
although keen of sight, are not very discriminating.
Birds, as well as wild animals, will
frequently continue their course when it lies
in the direction of a human being, provided
there is no perceptible movement to attract
their attention. Any kind of motion is immediately
noticed, particularly if it is at all
sudden. Stationary objects are not apt to
attract much attention unless there is something
very strange in their appearance, especially
if the coloring does not harmonize with
the general surroundings and happens to be
different from what is ordinarily seen.</p>

<p>Animals use their faculties in a very
mechanical way, and this observation is more
true of sight than of any other sense. I have
seen a pack of dogs which had followed a
bobcat’s tracks to a tree where they supposed
it had taken refuge, baying and standing
guard, while it was perfectly evident to any
one who was not blind that the cat had escaped.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
The sense of smell had directed the
dogs to the spot, and relying upon the information
received in that way, they failed to
avail themselves of the intelligence they might
have derived from another source. I have
no doubt that the sight of dogs is particularly
keen, but they rely almost entirely upon the
sense of smell. When the mind is greatly
absorbed in one direction, it is for the time
being far less observant or attentive in other
ways. A human being depends mostly upon
the sight, and next upon hearing; the sense
of smell is the least used of any of the senses.
Among animals, with few exceptions, smell
is the principal sense, and all the others are
little used in comparison, although very acute.</p>

<p>Having secured a good deer trophy, I next
turned my thoughts to a different kind of
hunting, and concluded that antelope would
afford a pleasing variety, both as a prize and
in the method of hunting.</p>

<p>The next day the outfit was got in readiness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
and we started for a place called Hayden,
located in California Park. The sun had
melted the snow, and the journey was hot
and dusty. Traveling over the steep mountain
trails, the guide gave me the lead, while
he rode at the rear of the pack horses strung
out in single file, and made use of all the arts
of persuasion to keep them going, frequently
leaning down to pick up a rock or a stick to
hurl at some “ornery” beast that would turn
a deaf ear to the appeal, “Wake up and pay
for your bedding.” Speeches in true cowboy
style, with plenty of rhetorical flourishes, were
delivered almost without intermission, when
the traveling was particularly difficult.</p>

<p>After leaving the timber, we had a tedious
journey through long stretches of sage brush.
The land where the sage brush abounds seems
desolate and forsaken, and would impress the
casual observer as perfectly worthless. While
reflecting upon the forbidding aspect of the
country, I wondered if this land could be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
rendered productive upon the arrival of that
era “when the desert would blossom as the
rose.” I discovered an answer to my question
ere long, when my sight was gladdened
by a neat little ranch located near a stream,
with about two acres of ground irrigated
and under cultivation. If it had been an oasis
in a desert, the contrast could not have been
more striking. A great stack of alfalfa hay
stood near the ranch, exposing a cut in its
side which revealed the interior perfectly
green. At first I thought that the grass had
not been properly cured, but I learned afterward
that the alfalfa contains so much nutriment
that it remains green a long time after
it has been cured and stacked. There were
quite a number of fruit trees of small size so
laden with fruit that the branches had to be
propped. All that is needed to make the soil
productive, is to clear off the sage brush, and
irrigate.</p>

<p>We camped that night by a stream in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
clump of aspen trees, many of which, although
dead, were still standing. The aspen when
dead becomes exceedingly dry and light, and
makes a very hot and bright fire, but quickly
burns out, leaving a small quantity of ashes
to the amount of wood consumed. After the
evening meal, we piled the dead aspen wood
upon the fire until it formed a heap nearly as
high as our heads. The flames shot well into
the air and lighted up the landscape for a
considerable distance. Listening to the guide
spinning his yarns as we lay by the cheerful
blaze, the time slipped by rapidly. It may
not be out of place to relate one of the stories
my guide told me, as a sample of the kind
of intellectual treat they furnished.</p>

<p>Among his acquaintances was a telegraph
operator at a place called Red Wing on the
Denver and Rio Grande Railroad. The
operator had taught the guide a smattering of
telegraphy, and the sequel will prove the truth
of the saying that “a little knowledge is a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
dangerous thing.” The operator was on very
friendly terms with a young lady in the same
employment at a station not many miles away,
and when business was slack they freely corresponded
in complimentary and sometimes
sentimental messages, until at length their
feelings toward each other had deepened into
something more than friendship. One day
the guide dropped into the office, and while
he was there, the operator had to leave for a
short time on other business. During his
absence a message came over the wire of
the usual sentimental kind. The “chargé
d’affaires” did not recognize the sender nor
understand the message, but being possessed
of ready wit and unlimited assurance, he immediately
sent back a reply characterized by
brevity, force and spiciness. When the regular
operator returned and endeavored to resume
a tête-à-tête he could get no response,
nor was further communication continued, except
in the ordinary course of business. An
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
effort to obtain an explanation received no
notice, as he was supposed to be the guilty
party and naturally would understand the
cause of the trouble well enough without it.
While the operator was pouring out the burden
of his troubled soul to the guide a few
days after, a suspicion flashed across the mind
of the latter that perhaps the fragrant message
he had sent at random might have been
the cause of the misunderstanding. He so
informed the operator, and matters were
finally satisfactorily explained, and the former
friendly relations restored.</p>

<p>When California Park was at length
reached, we found the country very hilly, but
open. There were a number of antelope in
that locality, but it was almost impossible to
get a good shot at one. The atmosphere is
so deceptive that it is very difficult to gauge
the distance. I made a good many quite
accurate line shots, but they were invariably
either too high or too low. It was some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
time before I could form a correct idea of the
distance. I believe it is best for any one
shooting in a strange country where distances
are deceptive, to ask information of the guide,
so that he may be able to sight his rifle at the
right elevations. In an open country, where
the atmosphere is rarefied and objects are seen
very distinctly, it is easy to underestimate the
range of your mark; while in the timber, particularly
if it is fairly dense, the tendency is
to overestimate and consequently shoot too
high. After a couple of days, I at last succeeded
in bagging an antelope and tried to
run down on horseback another one that I had
creased, but it managed to escape. It would
frequently stop and look back while being
pursued. Once I checked my horse and
waited. The antelope stood still and watched
me at a safe distance. I observed that it grew
no weaker from the loss of blood, and when I
resumed the chase I became convinced that it
was probably more than a match in speed for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
my jaded horse. I did not seem to gain on
it, and the horse was showing great distress
under the strain. I had not the heart to apply
the stimulus to make him quicken his pace as
the guide did to his horse, fairly raking his
sides from the shoulders down with the great
Mexican spurs until they were red with
blood.</p>

<p>My experience in hunting antelope convinces
me that a sportsman earns about every
trophy he gets. No man can be a sluggard
and succeed in hunting this kind of game.
With senses as acute as any wild animals
possess, they live in an open country, where
every object is visible except for the slight
concealment offered by the sage brush or some
depression of the ground. The antelope have
one stupid habit&mdash;very remarkable on account
of their keenness in other respects. They will
almost always follow their leader, strung out
in single file, notwithstanding that in doing so
the end of the line may come close to a hunter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
in pursuit who is cutting across their course.
When the line is strung out to a considerable
length, and the mounted hunter is not more
than a few hundred yards away and is riding
at right angles to the course that the antelope
are pursuing, it can readily be seen that the
last of the herd will have allowed the pursuer
to gain considerable distance. There has
been a good deal of discussion in regard to
the possibility of running antelope down by
mounted hunters. The stratagem usually
employed is to surround a bunch of antelope
by making a wide circle sufficiently large to
avoid giving immediate alarm to the herd.
Several men begin the chase by riding toward
them from several widely separated points
and driving the herd in the direction of another
group of hunters, who are concealed
from sight in some depression of the ground.
When the herd reaches the point where the
other hunters are concealed, they are pursued
by men on fresh mounts. Sometimes the herd
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
is scattered, and some stray confused animal
will try to rejoin the others, and in doing so
will run straight in the direction of his comrades,
quite regardless of the closeness of his
pursuers. I saw one lone distracted animal
trying to rejoin the herd come within sixty
yards of a dismounted hunter, who tried to
get a shot at it, but was prevented by his
horse straying in front of him and moving
in such a way that his aim was cut off, until
the antelope had considerably increased the
distance, and then escaped the shots fired.</p>

<p>My time being limited, I was compelled to
cut my antelope hunt short without having
secured a suitable trophy, although I had
plenty of hard riding and excitement. On
the return trip, as the guide and myself sat
by the camp-fire, a cowboy joined us who
became quite companionable, and gave us all
the news after his mind had been sufficiently
stimulated by several generous pulls at the
flask. It appeared that a couple of days before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
an attempt had been made one night to
rob the bank at Meeker. Before the robbers
could accomplish their purpose, the citizens
discovered what was taking place and quietly
surrounded the building. When the men
came out they were shot down and killed;
the ends of justice were thereby satisfied without
the proverbial law’s delay. The cowboy
then told me of another bank, in which he
was a depositor, which had been robbed not
long before by one of its officers, who had
gotten off with a considerable sum. I asked
him what the liabilities were. The word staggered
him. Although I recognized that he
was a man of resources, yet I felt sure that I
had “stumped him,” and felt sorry for it. He
stared vacantly at the fire a few moments and
slowly shifted a quid from one side of his
mouth to the other and sent a long, yellow
stream into the center of the blaze, which I
thought for a moment would extinguish it;
at length he replied in a leisurely way: “Wal,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
pardner, the liabilities are&mdash;if they catch him
they will hang him.”</p>

<p>Two days afterward I took leave of my
guide; I felt as I clasped his great strong hand
that the compression came as much from the
heart as the muscles.</p>

<p>I soon found myself again in civilized surroundings.
A barber’s skill, a warm bath and
conventional attire had already wrought a
wonderful transformation. As I sat in a comfortable
seat and looked out of the car
window, observing the strange and beautiful
scenery, so continually changing with the
rapid movement of the train, every hour
covering a greater distance than I could travel
with a pack outfit in a day, I felt how much
easier it was to take it all in this way; no
fractious horse to control; free from the burning
sun, which would often shoot down its
rays upon one like the heat waves from a
furnace, and while in the midst of this ordeal,
the climate would sometimes suddenly change
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
with the clouds gathering in the sky, and a
cold wave, perhaps accompanied by a snowstorm,
would follow. When I reflect upon
my experience in after years, the scenery I
observed so rapidly and with no effort, reappears
to my mind like a blurred photograph
as compared to what I saw while traveling
with the pack outfit. The charm of natural
scenery grows upon one by degrees; whoever
thinks that the charm wanes when the novelty
has worn off is not a true admirer of nature.</p>

<p>Whatever opinion one may entertain of
the foregoing statement, it is very certain
that the sportsman cannot gratify his favorite
desire and at the same time consult his ease
in all respects. A royal sportsman may afford
the luxury of having a force of game keepers
drive wild beasts within range of his rifle,
and imagine that he is enjoying the real thing.
The average man has no such opportunity,
and I believe has no reason to regret it. The
best hunting sections of the country are remote
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
from settlements, and are generally
somewhat difficult of access. Game is by no
means so plentiful now as it was when the
country was being opened to civilizing influence
by the introduction of railroads. It
is no longer possible for a wealthy man,
who likes sport without inconvenience and
hardship, to have his parlor car side-tracked,
and to make it a headquarters while enjoying
the pastime. One is compelled to rough it to
some extent to obtain success in hunting big
game at the present time. But after all, is
that an objection? Does it not put a keen
edge on the sportsman’s desire? Those hunting
incidents which have given me the greatest
trouble and exercised my skill the most are
the ones I recall with greatest pleasure.

<h2 id="EXPENSE_OF_AN_OUTING">EXPENSE OF AN OUTING</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> expense of a Western hunting trip
after big game, and what is necessary
to make it a success, will largely depend upon
how much or how little one requires. The
average man, accustomed to the ordinary
comforts of civilized environment, should be
careful to supply himself with as many of
these as possible, without too greatly increasing
the expense and the bulk of what has to
be transported.</p>

<p>The season of the year makes a difference
also. In the late fall or during the winter any
one who is not accustomed to camping out in
cold weather will find a tent with a light,
portable sheet-iron stove, which can easily be
carried on a horse’s back, very serviceable.</p>

<p>My last hunting trip in the West was late
in the fall, and I had everything complete.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
I will enumerate what I took and then state
the cost: I had a guide and a cook; a tent
for myself and another which served as
quarters for the three men and also for a
dining pavilion; a sheet-iron stove for each
tent, which, with several lengths of pipe
weighed very little; two folding tables and
several chairs that packed into very small
space; plenty of warm bedding and underwear;
a liberal supply of canned stuff&mdash;soups,
meats, vegetables, preserves, etc.&mdash;besides the
usual standbys, flour, bacon, my rifle, ammunition,
etc., and a few books to read when
I was tired of hunting and wanted to loaf in
camp. The cost was as follows: Guide, $3
per day; horse wrangler, $2 per day; cook,
$3 per day; eight pack horses, 50 cents apiece
per day; six dogs, no charge.</p>

<p>Provisions, consisting principally of canned
stuff, at from 15 to 20 cents a can, I purchased
at St. Anthony, Idaho. I had about
$60 worth of canned stuff, and had some left
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
over after camping out thirty days. In round
figures it cost me about $14 a day while camping
out. This expense can be cut down, if
one wishes to economize. Great care, however,
should be taken about attempting to cut
off too much.</p>

<p>I have heard much adverse criticism in
regard to canned goods, but in my own experience
I find them most serviceable. What
are generally sold contain, as a rule, a large
quantity of water, and this adds unnecessarily
to the weight and bulk. A great deal of this
may be had in a condensed form; before
cooking, water can be added to it.</p>

<p>The success of a hunting trip depends
almost entirely upon the guide. Great care
should be taken against securing the services
of any one without first finding out something
about him in advance. If you are fifty or
one hundred miles out in the wilderness and
your guide should prove unsatisfactory, you
cannot conveniently dispense with his services.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
In that case you have nothing to do but to
make the best of a bad bargain.</p>

<p>With the disappearance of big game almost
everywhere, and the greater difficulty of
securing it, more skill and special knowledge
are required now than formerly. There are
a good many men who have shot large game
and lived in the wilderness who would not
make competent guides. The man whose
time is limited must select as his guide someone
who has a good knowledge of woodcraft,
understands the habits of wild animals and is
able to furnish a good outfit.

<h2 id="A_NEW_BRUNSWICK_HUNT">A NEW BRUNSWICK HUNT</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> Province of New Brunswick, in the
neighborhood of the Tobique River,
was once noted as a favorite resort for caribou,
but for some reason this fickle, migratory
animal has become somewhat scarce in that
locality. The moose has become more abundant.
Various reasons are given for the
diminishing number of caribou and the increase
of moose, but I do not undertake to
explain the cause of the change. There are
certainly quite a number of moose in the
country, and if one is not too eager to shoot
the first chance he gets, and will wait till he
sees a good head, a hunt of several weeks
ought to secure satisfactory results. The law
allows a sportsman only one moose, and that
fact should make him careful about bagging
anything which comes in sight.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>

<p>The true sportsman should form a resolution
to secure a good trophy or nothing. It
is pitiable to see what rubbish some people
lug out of the woods&mdash;heads that are wanting
in size and defective in fair proportions. The
head of the moose lacks the grace and beauty
of outline which characterize the elk, the only
large animal of this continent which can
compare with it in size, and so it must make
up in massiveness what it lacks in other respects.
Whether large or small, an elk’s
head is almost invariably beautiful and graceful.
In securing a trophy one can afford to
be more independent of size when an elk
head is the object sought, and not the head
of a moose.</p>

<p>The attractiveness of a moose head consists
largely in its grotesqueness; the size has quite
as much to do with that as its shape.</p>

<p>If one intends to hunt in New Brunswick,
a great deal depends upon the kind of hunting
desired, whether one goes early or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
late in the season. In the early part of the
season, say from the first of September to the
25th of October, there is little or no snow,
and at that time it is extremely difficult to get
any large game by stalking, for the ground
is covered with dry leaves and brittle wood,
which make considerable noise at every step.
At that season one must depend largely upon
canoe work and calling for moose, while
caribou and deer are then still more difficult
to hunt.</p>

<p>Moose frequently come down to the water,
of which they are very fond, and in which
they bathe and wallow. Caribou are less apt
to frequent such spots. Calling is a favorite
method of bringing moose within range, but
great care has to be exercised, for a single
false note and your noble quarry, instead of
accepting an invitation to a funeral, which he
is to grace, will retire to a place of safety.</p>

<p>When there are a few inches of snow on
the ground, hunting becomes more attractive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
to the sportsman. Instead of sitting in his
canoe waiting for something to come within
range, he is vigorously exercising his muscles
and his knowledge of woodcraft to secure a
shot, and often his skill is put to a considerable
test in shooting through thick timber.</p>

<p>There is nothing more improving to
health and conducive to happiness than
strenuous exercise in the cold, bracing air,
with sport as an incentive. Whatever may be
the outcome of your hunting, you are sure to
take out of the woods with you an increased
supply of vital energy and robustness, which,
after all, is very important. If your hunting
should not furnish you with such tangible
results as you would like to see, console
yourself with the reflection that a very wealthy
man once offered “a million dollars for a new
stomach,” and perhaps you have secured an
equivalent for a great deal less.</p>

<p>Early in October of 1904 I joined my guide
at the forks of the Tobique. We immediately
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
started out in a canoe, into which I
packed all my things, to pole up the Little
Tobique. The water was pretty high, and
this increased the difficulty of ascending the
river, whose current, naturally strong, was
interspersed by rocks and the débris of stray
logs and woodland refuse. The sturdy skill
of the guide was considerably taxed in spite
of the small assistance rendered by me with
the paddle; and yet I was of some assistance
in forcing the canoe over places where there
was no poling bottom. In about five hours
we reached our destination and put up at the
camp, which consisted of a very commodious
log cabin, where we found the cook, who soon
began to busy himself in preparing the evening
meal. The two succeeding mornings I
got up before day, while stars were still
bright, and returned late in the morning,
having as a reward for my pains a good
appetite and plenty to satisfy it, when I could
succeed in getting it down. The third morning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
both the guide and myself overslept, and
with a blush of shame I encountered the glare
of Old Sol as he fiercely showered his burning
rays upon our heads.</p>

<p>That same morning a lazy bull moose had
been guilty of the same offense, and appeared
at the bank of the river to take his belated
bath just as our canoe came dancing and
twisting down the swift, turbid stream toward
him. The big bull did not seem in the least
concerned, although every moment we were
rapidly drawing nearer. If he had been
standing in the water, I believe he would
have let us run into him had we been disposed
to do so. With a quick movement of the
paddle, the guide turned the canoe so that I
could secure an easy position to shoot, and
then a sharp crack of the Mauser rifle, followed
by the heavy swaying motion of the
animal as he sank down to pour out his life
blood on the sand, closed the incident.</p>

<p>The head measured fifty-two inches, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
was quite shapely. As I surveyed the prostrate
form of this pride of the Canadian
forest, I thought that it was no particular
skill of mine which had brought it within
easy reach and secured me a fine trophy. It
seemed to me as though the original owner of
the antlers had almost made me a present of
them. We do not greatly appreciate things
which come too easily into our possession.
I would have been better pleased if the royal
beast had made the shot more difficult and
had given me a chance to exercise my skill.
He may have mistaken me for one of those
sportsmen who tremblingly pass the gun to
the guide and ask him to shoot.</p>

<p>During that time I saw another moose,
which I declined to shoot, because, as I informed
a friend, I had all the law allowed,
and for the further reason that “it had no
head.” When I informed my friend that
the moose “had no head,” he seemed somewhat
incredulous, but after I explained that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
this was an Irish bull, he seemed better
satisfied.</p>

<p>During the rest of my sojourn I had considerable
amusement in shooting at a mark
with my .22 automatic Winchester, which
affords plenty of practice without making too
much noise, and is also useful for small game.</p>

<p>The return trip home was diversified with
the common experiences of the transition
from the rough camp life to your own fireside,
when you sit in an easy chair and talk
it all over with your friends. Sixty miles’
paddling down the Tobique, ever impelled
by its rapid though wayward current, which
required the constant correction of your
course, and gave delight in the survey of the
beautiful banks, decorated by the virgin forest
for miles, marked the first day’s journey.
The next day a ride in stuffy cars over a
second-class railroad, until you finally land in
a Pullman coach and spin along at the rate
of sixty miles an hour. Perhaps you pick
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
up a chance acquaintance in one or two sportsmen
who have just returned from a similar
outing, and tell you of their mighty deeds
which lose nothing by repetition; you shrink
within your modest little self as you listen,
for you know you have accomplished nothing
which will stand well in comparison.</p>

<p>On my way back I met several sportsmen,
one of whom related to me his exploits, which
were very tame on first recital. We were sitting
in the smoking apartment of the Pullman,
when presently two other sportsmen
came in and we got into conversation over
our different hunting experiences. The two
sportsmen who came in last related the wonderful
feats which they had accomplished.
After they had talked themselves out, my
first acquaintance, who had been so modest
in what he related, much to my surprise took
a fresh start. I think a couple of good drinks,
which stimulated his imagination and stirred
his personal pride, had something to do with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
it. With an eloquence which truly surprised
me, he added the “verisimilitude of truth to
otherwise bald and uninteresting statement of
facts.” It was evident that the newcomers
were outclassed, for my modest friend was
not only gifted of tongue, but he told his
story last. I have discovered that there are
more ways than one of establishing a reputation
as a sportsman, and sometimes the “gift
o’ gab” is more important than skill in
handling a rifle.

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> mountain lion of the West is the
panther or cougar of our Eastern
States, sometimes called “painter” by the old-fashioned
backwoodsman; in some localities
it goes by the name of “Indian devil,” no
doubt on account of the weird, unearthly
noises it makes at night. In Mexico it is
known as the “puma,” and grows to a larger
size than elsewhere. In appearance the mountain
lion is very similar to the African lioness,
having a smooth, tawny skin, without any
mane; a full-grown animal that will measure
from seven to eight feet from its nose to the
end of the tail and weighs about 180 pounds,
is considered a large specimen. They seldom
exceed this, and more frequently fall below it.</p>

<p>Although often engaged in hunting big
game, I never saw a mountain lion at large
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
except when one has been rounded up by a
pack of dogs. In their habits they are stealthy
and secretive, carefully keeping concealed,
and never willing to fight unless cornered,
with no chance of escape. Occasionally, when
the odds are overwhelmingly in its favor, a
lion will provoke a battle, but this is not often
the case.</p>

<p>In disposition and character the mountain
lion belies its name; of all carnivorous beasts
it is, perhaps, the most cowardly. Being exceedingly
destructive, it not only kills for
food, but it also kills out of wantonness. I
have run across numbers of deer that have
been destroyed by the same animal within
short distances of each other, the carcasses
being allowed to remain almost entire. It
has also been stated on good authority that
one lion will be likely to kill in the course of a
year about one hundred and fifty deer.</p>

<p>Considering its destructive disposition, I
have no doubt that in a country where the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
deer are at all numerous, this statement is not
far from the truth. The ranchman has a
cordial hatred for this destroyer of his stock,
and the cunning displayed by the lion in
evading traps and turning away from poisoned
meat makes him all the more unpopular. This
animal will not eat of any kill unless it is his
own or that of some other lion. Extremity of
hunger may cause him to act differently, but
it is exceptional. Most success in hunting this
game is to be found in localities where the deer
are plentiful. It is practically useless to attempt
any hunting of this kind unless you have
a pack of well trained dogs handled by some
one who has complete control over them.
Great care and patience has to be exercised in
breaking a pack of dogs for this purpose, and
to prevent them from running other game.
If, for example, a pack should take after a
timber wolf, that animal is so fleet that he
would distance most of his pursuers and string
them out considerably. The wolf has been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
known to turn on the pack thus separated and
kill a number of the dogs, one after the other,
before the pack could be united. The disappointed
huntsman, reaching the end of the run
on his jaded horse, might survey the remnants
of his pack&mdash;first the survivors with downcast
heads and apologetic tails between their
legs&mdash;and then some dog fur scattered over
the blood-bespattered ground, and here and
there a mangled corpse. It is no joke to have
a pack run for miles after the wrong game
over rough country, your whole day’s sport
broken up, and perhaps lose your dogs for
several days.</p>

<p>The mountain lion has not much endurance
in the chase, although very fast for a short
distance, which he covers by a series of leaps.
In a short time he is treed or driven to the
ledge of a precipice or into some hiding place.
If you are fond of hunting with a camera, you
generally have ample time to take a photograph
of your prize, perhaps posing in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
branches of a tree and looking as pleasant as
possible&mdash;for a mountain lion!</p>

<p>The lively serenade furnished by the dogs,
which the lion recognizes by continual growls,
displaying his whole set of ivories, completes
a scene not soon forgotten. Your share of
the business is very tame, although absolutely
effective. A shot at close range behind the
shoulder, and the lion tumbles among the
savage dogs to engage in a losing fight; while
in the agony of death, not infrequently he
leaves some little reminders of his long claws
and strong teeth upon his assailants.</p>

<p>In the month of January, 1900, I engaged
the services of John B. Goff, who possessed a
good pack of dogs to hunt “lions” and “cats”
in Colorado. The “cats” referred to are
bobcats, not the Canada lynx with which they
are sometimes confounded. The winter was
unusually free from snowfalls, and the ground
being very dry, it made hunting difficult, because
the dogs could hardly follow the scent.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span></p>

<p>My first destination was a ranch on Strawberry
Creek belonging to the guide, about
twelve miles from Meeker. Here for several
days we engaged in a fruitless hunt, until one
morning a fresh fall of snow covered the
ground, when our efforts were rewarded by
the dogs striking a couple of cat trails; these
we followed a short distance, with the whole
pack tearing away ahead of us in full cry. The
dogs followed the trail to a great pile of massive
rocks, which towered a hundred feet
above our heads, and there became bewildered.
What had become of the stealthy
bobcats? The guide and myself climbed the
rocks to search for them. Looking down
from the summit I saw one of them lying in
front of a cave surveying the dogs, which
were silently and swiftly nosing around below
it. It was easy enough to shoot the cat where
it was, but as it rested on the ledge of a rock
of some breadth, it was a grave question
whether it might not die there where it would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
be practically inaccessible, and we would have
all our pains for nothing.</p>

<p>To drive the cat from its position into a
better one was more than a doubtful possibility,
as it was likely to run back into the cave.
So I took a chance and fired. Like a crash of
lightning above their heads, the excited dogs
heard the report and knew that “there was
something doing.” The wounded cat gave a
sudden leap into space and fell among them.
If there is any question about a “cat having
nine lives,” it seems that the dogs were bound
to be on the safe side, for they mauled the
remains until I began to fear that the fur
might be damaged before I could come to
the rescue. Through a fatal curiosity, the
other cat peeped over the precipice, and paid
for its rashness with its hide, which I added
to my collection. The job of skinning the
cats I turned over to the guide.</p>

<p>The big dogs sat around in sullen dignity,
particularly avoiding any familiarity with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
smaller dogs and with each other. Each one
seemed to consider himself the hero of the
occasion. I have had occasion to observe that
the pack would work and fight well together,
but after the fray they seemed to be intensely
jealous of each other.</p>

<p>Several of the dogs interested me considerably.
One of them was called “Old Jim,”
a big black-and-tan foxhound, with a deep
bass voice which would swell the chorus when
the pack was in full cry and sometimes almost
drown it. Old Jim would occasionally provoke
the not over angelic temper of the guide
by leading the whole pack after a coyote. On
one occasion he had distinguished himself by
whipping a coyote, and whenever one of these
“sassy” prairie wolves would show itself, he
could not resist the temptation of giving chase,
leading the whole pack after him.</p>

<p>Any one acquainted with Western hunting
knows how useless it is for dogs to attempt to
outrun a coyote. The coyotes would frequently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
come close to the pack, if there was
no man nearby, as though to provoke a chase
for our special annoyance. The dogs, however,
would never run the coyotes’ trail; they
were broken of that.</p>

<p>Another interesting acquaintance was a dog
called Turk, a cross-breed, but a very strong
and stubborn fighter, all seamed with scars.
Turk kept near the guide, and did not run
with the pack except when there was something
in view. He was a good-natured dog
ordinarily, but an ugly customer in a scrap.</p>

<p>There was another dog called Boxer which
had a very keen scent; long before the rest
could discover a trail one could hear Boxer’s
knowing yelps, which would gradually develop
into a chorus, as one by one the other
dogs would detect the scent as it became
warmer. Boxer had more judgment than any
other dog in the pack, and was very good in
puzzling out a broken trail.</p>

<p>We spent several days longer at the ranch
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
on Strawberry Creek. While there the guide
purchased a broken-down horse to feed to the
dogs. It is not a particularly easy matter to
keep twenty-one dogs supplied with food.
When the horse was led out for execution the
dogs became intensely excited and seemed to
know “what was up.” The moment the
animal was shot, and almost before it fell to
the ground, the whole pack of dogs, big and
small, was tearing eagerly at the carcass. No
doubt the habit of attacking wild animals as
soon as they have been shot developed their
naturally savage dispositions.</p>

<p>At the suggestion of the guide, we decided
to go to a ranch near the Bear River Cañon,
two days’ journey from our present location.
When we arrived at the ranch, after a long
day’s ride on horseback, we found the ranchman’s
wife keeping house; her husband had
left for several days. She seemed in no condition
to entertain us on account of a bad
headache, but kindly offered to do whatever
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
she could. We volunteered to help her out
with her domestic duties. First of all I prescribed
for her headache; the medicine went
down the wrong way, which caused her to
vomit, after which she declared she felt better.
My professional pride did not permit
me to enlighten her as to the unexpected result
of my prescription. I say professional
pride, because I went by the nickname of the
Doctor on account of an emergency case I
carried with me.</p>

<p>I made myself useful in doing most of the
chores usual on such occasions, while the guide
held the baby, which howled incessantly. The
expression on his face while performing this
duty was as angelic as I have seen it when
Old Jim would lead the whole pack off on a
chase after a coyote against his impotent protest.
When the meal was served, two other
children turned up, one a little girl nine years
old, who was censured for not taking care of
the baby; the other a boy of about eleven,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
who was particularly good, according to his
mother’s account of him. Our first day’s experience
with these interesting children caused
us to reverse the parental opinion. When we
returned from our hunt the evening of the
following day, the guide missed his lasso; the
good little boy had tried to lasso a cat which
was selecting some delicacies from a tin can,
the cat took a sudden leap to escape the lasso,
and in doing so shoved its head into the can
and cinched the lasso round its body; cat, can
and lasso disappeared in the sage brush and
were never found.</p>

<p>The country around Bear River Cañon is
very rough and picturesque. The cañon is
steep and cuts a great gorge in the mountain,
and is very difficult to cross. In one place
we were headed off by the precipice, which
must have been fully a thousand feet in depth;
I rolled a stone off the edge, and its descent
seemed to take a considerable time. A shower
of broken fragments and dust, followed a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
second or two afterward by a dull crash which
reverberated through the cañon, announced
the termination of its fall.</p>

<p>The dogs finally succeeded in jumping a
lion, running right upon him. From a distance
I could see the chase along the side of
a mountain until it turned in the direction of
the cañon. The lion did not seem to be going
very fast while covering the ground by long
leaps, which he appeared to do without much
effort; but when I looked at the pack, which
did not seem to be gaining on him, they were
straining every nerve, and looked as if they
were “going it for all they were worth.” No
doubt the easy gait of the lion made his speed
deceptive. The lion took refuge upon a ledge
of the precipice some fifteen feet below the
crest. When we arrived at the spot the dogs
were raising an awful din in their impotent
frenzy, as they looked down upon the smiling
countenance of the lion, which was displaying
all his teeth. It was thought inadvisable to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
shoot the lion on the ledge where he was, because
there was a good chance of his dying in
an inaccessible spot, so we dropped stones on
him, hoping to drive him out of that place
and compel him to run to the top of the
precipice and take refuge in a tree.</p>

<p>For some time the lion savagely snapped at
the stones, much to our diversion. In their
eagerness to see the lion the dogs crowded one
another near the edge of the precipice, and
occasionally crowded me. As I leaned over
to drop a stone on the lion’s tail a big
dog planted his forefeet on my shoulders.
Perhaps he did this to get a better view,
or it may have been because he was not
able to say “down in front,” that he
adopted this method of giving me a gentle
hint that I was obstructing his view. The
action was not pleasant to me. I did not relish
the idea of being shoved over the precipice
and dashed to pieces below, with the possible
alternative of landing on the ledge where the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
lion was located. Our efforts at last resulted
in causing the tormented beast to seek refuge
elsewhere. After abandoning the ledge he ran
upon the top of the precipice and came so
close to me that I could have touched him&mdash;but
I didn’t. A little foxhound ventured too
close and his impertinence was rewarded by
a snap from the lion which grazed the dog’s
head and slit his ear in twain. Instead of
taking to a tree, as we had vainly hoped, the
lion discovered a way of getting down upon
another ledge of the precipice, more inaccessible
than the first, and became concealed from
view. It became evident that we were taking
too many chances, so the guide and myself
found a way, very steep and rough, below the
lion’s last resort, where it was just possible
to see, several hundred feet away, the head
and neck of the animal. I took careful aim
and fired. The bullet went a little higher
than I intended, breaking the lower jaw. I
wished to preserve the skull entire for a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
mount; but the character of the wound inflicted
made this impossible. In spite of the
injury received the tawny form glided along
the almost perpendicular side of the precipice,
picking out here and there a foot rest to aid
in its ascent. I fired another shot, which
struck behind the shoulder, but did not stop
the animal from reaching the top of the
precipice, where the dogs soon discovered
him. I was not too late to see some of the
fight. In the scrimmage the lion got Turk’s
head partly in his mouth, and for a moment I
felt alarmed on account of the dog. Fortunately,
the lion’s lower jaw refused to work,
and Turk got off with light punishment&mdash;merely
a scalp wound, from which the blood
flowed freely.</p>

<p>I began to arrange my camera, intending
to take a snap-shot of the melee, but the shade
of the trees made the light bad for an instantaneous
photograph, the only one that could
be taken of a moving scene; the guide,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
seeing my dilemma, caught hold of the lion’s
tail, while still fighting the dogs, and dragged
the tangled bunch a few yards down the side
of the hill into the sunlight. When this was
done the lion was dead, and I was not able to
accomplish my purpose. As I surveyed my
first lion trophy I could not help admiring the
game fight it had put up against hopeless
odds. There could be no skepticism respecting
the execution of its terrible teeth, for not
a few wounds were inflicted on the dogs.
The beast must have weighed 170 to 180
pounds, and its skin was in fine condition; but,
unfortunately, the skull was ruined.</p>

<p>After hard hunting for about a week, the
dogs took up a fresh scent, and in a short
time they treed a small lion which the guide
called a “kitten,” because it was not full
grown. The branches of the tree were quite
close together and near the ground. One of
the dogs managed to climb a considerable
way up the tree by the aid of the easy support
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
the branches afforded, and was in some peril.
The report of my rifle helped to swell the
chorus of the dogs, which only abated when
their jaws were employed to a better purpose
on the struggling “kitten.” The poor beast
which had climbed the tree remained a disappointed
spectator of the fight, being unable
to take part. Afterward I helped him down
from his ridiculous although somewhat dangerous
position.</p>

<p>On a number of occasions the dogs have
climbed trees for a considerable distance above
the ground. The piñon trees, where the lions
frequently take refuge, are supplied with
branches which begin to sprout near the base,
rendering the feat easier of accomplishment,
but nevertheless it is a remarkable sight to see
a dog up a tree, sometimes furnishing an unwilling
subject for a camera. Any one wishing
to obtain some impression of how a dog
would look in such an attitude can have his
curiosity satisfied by examining the photographs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
of wild animals in Mr. Wallihan’s
remarkable book, where snap-shots were taken
of some of the dogs which were in the pack I
hunted with.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i065" src="images/i065.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">HITTING THE TRAIL.</p></div>

<p>We had barely skinned the “kitten,” when
at some distance we heard the pack baying
another animal. We rode as rapidly as possible
in the direction we heard the noise. We
soon arrived at the edge of the valley, which
lay some five or six hundred feet below. The
baying broke upon our hearing with great distinctness.
The country beneath was free from
big timber, being dotted profusely with piñon
trees and smaller growth, with here and there
great pillars of red sandstone fashioned into
mushroom shapes by the erosion of the elements
through countless ages. In the clear,
bright sunshine every object stood out with
great distinctness, producing a curious and
beautiful effect.</p>

<p>It was an attractive sight to watch the pack
as it swiftly coursed about in the valley. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
finally disappeared around the base of the
mountain. We took a short cut across the spur
of the mountain and soon caught the steady
baying of the dogs, and I knew that something
was treed or cornered. On the side of a steep
slope, which extended hundreds of feet down
to the valley, stood a piñon tree with a fine,
large lion perched in its branches&mdash;a more
beautiful pose for a photograph I could hardly
imagine. The light was good and the surroundings
all that could be desired to produce
the proper effect. The guide suggested a
doubt in regard to the lion’s remaining in his
present position very long, and that one of us
should cover him with a rifle while the other
used the camera. My love of sport is not so
platonic that I could readily forego the deadly
part of the pastime for the æsthetic. So I
held the rifle carefully pointed at a vital spot,
and after a little space the animal quivered,
as though just about in the act of taking a
spring out of the tree, which, had he effected,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
would have sent him down the slope at a speed
that would have distanced the dogs; once at
large in the rough country which spread
through the valley, he would have given us
another long and fatiguing chase, with a good
chance of losing him. Before the trembling
limbs could launch into space a bullet pierced
his heart and he tumbled from his perch and
rolled nearly a hundred feet down the mountain
side, where his further descent was
arrested by the dogs in no gentle fashion. The
struggle with the lion was brief. The guide
and myself had more of a struggle with the
dogs in driving them away from the carcass.</p>

<p>I was disappointed to learn that the guide
had not succeeded in getting a photo. If I
could have had a snap-shot with the camera at
the lion close by, while in the act of springing,
with satisfactory results, I would have had
something of more value than the animal’s
skin.</p>

<p>I added a few more trophies to my collection
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
before finishing my hunt for that season.
My experience, however, had convinced me
that the best reminiscences of a hunting trip
are good photographs of wild animals in
their natural state. The ease with which
trophies can often be secured, so far as the
question of skill is concerned, has somewhat
taken the keen edge off of my desire to kill.
Securing a good trophy is quite as often a
question of time and patience as skill. Coolness
is also required, for frequently easy shots
are missed through being over anxious.

<h2 id="DUCK_SHOOTING_IN_CALCASIEU">DUCK SHOOTING IN CALCASIEU
PARISH.</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">A few</span> years ago, before a great industry
had been developed in the vicinity
of Sulphur City, La., the natural conditions
in that locality were favorable to the
increase of migratory game. The ground
was low and marshy, but generally quite
flat; forests of resinous pine spread over a
considerable portion of the country. In
some places the trees grew to immense size,
their massive trunks ascending for seventy-five
or eighty feet without a branch. The
soil in such localities being free from underbrush
and covered with thick layers of pine
needles, yielded pleasantly under the step like
a soft plush carpet. Currents of air caressing
the treetops imparted the sound of the
surf beating the shore at a distance. Stretches
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
of open prairie covered with tall grass furnished
feeding spots for large flocks of ducks
and geese. When the attention was not too
much absorbed with larger game, one might
frequently hear the jacksnipe emit its peculiar
whistle as it shaped a zigzag course in its
flight. Other game was in less abundance.</p>

<p>I engaged an old “red bone” to act as my
guide. Legrand&mdash;the name by which I will
introduce the new acquaintance&mdash;was really
a Creole, but was said to have a cross of
Indian blood, just enough to enable him to
detect signs which escape the common eye.
A faithful, quiet, uncomplaining man, but
an excellent hunter according to his lights,
Legrand had no liking for the new-fangled
notions of modern sportsmen. He could
crawl through the brush or long grass with
all the stealthiness of a cat, every sense alert,
and in spite of wet, cold or any kind of discomfort
would doggedly stick to his task
until his game was secured. To this old-fashioned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
hunter every cartridge must represent
something. He was not satisfied with
“punching holes in the air.” A story is told
of Legrand upon which I would not care to
stake my reputation for veracity, although
somewhat characteristic of the man.</p>

<p>A ranchman living in that locality noticed
a small bunch of teal that were in the habit
of using in a pond not far from his dwelling.
He requested Legrand to try his luck with
them the next morning, when they could be
easily found. Legrand, however, was short
of ammunition, so the ranchman gave him
a shell which he jokingly remarked was
enough for a good shot, and he expected him
to come back with the whole bunch, numbering
six. On the ensuing day Legrand departed
before sunrise, but returned to breakfast
empty handed. “No ducks, Legrand?”
He shook his head; “No ducks.” The next
morning the result was the same. “No
ducks, Legrand?” “No ducks.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span></p>

<p>The third morning a shot was heard.
Legrand returned with three beautiful blue-winged
teal hanging from each shoulder.</p>

<p>“Legrand, how did you manage to have
so much luck all of a sudden, when you were
not able to get anything the two preceding
mornings?”</p>

<p>“To-day,” he replied, “was the first time
I could get them lined up so that I could bag
them all at one shot.”</p>

<p>It was my good fortune to make another
interesting acquaintance in a somewhat singular
way. One afternoon, when shooting on
the edge of a marsh close by the house where
I was sojourning, I became conscious of
someone near at hand. Turning around I
discovered an elderly man of dignified bearing,
whose round ruddy face, ornamented
with a long white flowing beard, rested upon
broad shoulders and sturdy frame. The expression
of his countenance was mild and
kindly, possessing a reflective cast, which was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
somewhat accentuated by a habit of slowly
stroking his beard. Much impressed, I regarded
him with a feeling of reverence. Had
I been present at a revival meeting, the pose
and genial appearance would have suited the
occasion, silence having been secured by the
exhortation, “Let us pray.” I broke the
magic spell by politely asking the new arrival
whether he was a sportsman and fond of
shooting. “Can I shoot? By&mdash;&mdash;” (a blue
streak a yard long imparted all necessary
emphasis). “Young man, before my eyes
went back on me, old Uncle Dave could hit
any living creature.”</p>

<p>After a brief conversation my new acquaintance
cordially invited me to visit him,
and also extended the privilege of occupying
his lodge at a place called Sabine Pass, about
twenty miles away. This is not the noted
Sabine Pass in Texas, but merely a local
name. All reports seemed to confirm the
reputation of Sabine Pass, so I concluded to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
fit out an expedition. I chartered a prairie
schooner and secured two horses which the
guide said he could get for nothing. I was
willing, however, to pay for what I got, but
was put off with some dignity. The old saying,
“Never look a gift horse in the mouth”
seems somewhat in point, so I will be sparing
of comments. It was a very safe team, but
not much at annihilating space. A young
man was engaged as cook. There was no
other addition to the party, save an old one-eyed
dog.</p>

<p>A long, wearisome day’s travel brought us
to a sheet of water which surrounded the
lodge. This resulted from the great quantity
of moisture that had accumulated from heavy
rainfalls. The cook rode ahead, exploring
the way. The team tremulously negotiated
the pass, but were soon in difficulties. One
of them falling down in about four feet of
water energetically strove to rise. Legrand,
jumping into the icy water, began to fix the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
harness, which was no easy task. It was too
dark to do anything, so the horses were uncoupled
from the schooner and driven ashore.
I mounted one horse behind the cook. The
animal became refractory and varied the
monotonous experience of the day by bucking
for a brief space. Finally the shipwrecked
crew were able to leave the schooner
in safety, with a few things absolutely necessary,
but by no means with all that were
desired.</p>

<p>The bright glow of a fire in the open
hearth of the lodge dispelled the gloom and
discomfort of our surroundings, but Legrand
was chilled to the bone and looked peaked
and miserable. My sympathy was excited,
and I prescribed a liberal dose from my
flask which immediately revived him. Fortunately
we had taken the precaution to cover
the contents of the wagon, which otherwise
would have suffered on account of the rain
that fell during the night. Our meagre repast
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
finished, it was not a great while before
one after another dozed off into fitful slumber.
One blanket covered the forms of three
men, and in place of under bedding and
spring mattress we had the board floor. The
steady pour of the rain resounded continually
upon the roof, while the snap of the pine
fagots mingled with the hiss of drops of
water falling on the burning embers. It is
not easy for three persons to sleep under one
blanket resting upon a hard surface. The
disposition to change position became a fixed
habit with all three, but invariably the one
who attempted it met with unreasonable
objections and muttered protests from the
other two. If one turned over all three had
to follow suit. It seemed to be a case where
the minority ruled, while the majority swore
at the minority. The one-eyed dog, becoming
restless from the cold when the fire went out,
repeatedly attempted to find a place for himself
under the blanket, but discovered that a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
triple alliance had been formed to eliminate
him completely. Finally he offered to compromise
by lying down on the outside of the
blanket above our prostrate forms, but this
accommodation was likewise unfeelingly rejected.
During that awful night every man’s
hand appeared to be against his neighbor and
all three united against the dog.</p>

<p>I was at length awakened from a semi-conscious
condition by Legrand, who was
about to light a fire.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Legrand?” I inquired.
“Are you getting cold?”</p>

<p>“It’s time to get up.”</p>

<p>“What time is it?”</p>

<p>“About 4 o’clock.”</p>

<p>How he knew I could not guess, but I was
only too ready to accept any excuse that
would rescue me from almost the worst night
I ever experienced. It was pitch dark, but
the rain had ceased, and the noise of game
stirring outside betokened the coming dawn.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
A dense fog hung over the prairie and when
light began to make an impression it was like
illuminating an opaque substance. It was
impossible to distinguish anything over six
yards away. Having removed everything
from the schooner the problem of dragging
it to dry land did not concern us.</p>

<p>The growing day was heralded by a perfect
Babel of voices. Invisible flocks of
ducks numbering thousands frequently stirred
the air with the rapid movements of their
wings, which sounded like an express train.
The measured honk of wild geese gave evidence
of their presence in no beggarly numbers.
At intervals the brant in the long sour
bog grass invited an easy shot. When matters
were straightened out no time was lost
in starting out for feathered game.</p>

<p>The hunt began as soon as we stepped outdoors.
Small bunches of ducks were passed
by unnoticed. Legrand did not believe in
wasting ammunition; I only had five hundred
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
shells. Presently we heard the calling of a
large number of brant. That interested
Legrand. The fog had lifted somewhat, but
still rendered objects indistinct unless they
were close at hand. I imitated Legrand in
all his movements; first the quiet, cautious
approach, gradually bending, until finally we
were crawling on our stomachs through the
grass and mud. We were already quite near
the brant and I was becoming apprehensive
lest we should delay too long. A large flock
of teal unexpectedly attracted my attention
on the left side and I motioned to Legrand.
He shook his head, but I signified that I was
satisfied to try my luck with them. Legrand
disapproved but yielded to my suggestion,
except that he drew a bead on the brant.
The report of four barrels seemed almost
muffled in the uproar caused by great flocks
of birds rising in every direction, churning
the air with their wings and filling space with
a discordant conglomeration of sounds from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
every species of web-footed fowl on the
prairie. When the gray mist had swallowed
the black mass, a pleasant sight welcomed our
eyes. The ground was plentifully covered
with limp forms, a handsome tribute to the
prowess of our guns. The beam of joy on
Legrand’s weatherbeaten face satisfied me
that so far we had not been unduly wasteful
of ammunition. Fearing lest there might be
some lingering doubt in his mind on the subject,
I sought to console him with the reflection
that I still had four hundred and ninety-six
shells left.</p>

<p>No time was lost in collecting the game.
I stuffed the big pockets of my hunting coat
with teal and brant. Legrand fastened them
to the fringes of his jacket until he was
almost covered with the dark bodies of brant
and the beautifully colored teal. I warned
Legrand to kill every bird he gathered, but
he was careless in carrying out my suggestion.
On the way back to the lodge I heard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
behind me a flutter of wings and several
quacks and caught a glimpse of a duck disappearing
in the fog. Legrand was standing
in a state of stupefaction, staring in the
direction the duck had flown. I could not
help laughing. Needless to say he made sure
of the rest.</p>

<p>Surfeited with abundance of game, the
pastime soon palled on me. After several
days’ sport I was ready to return to more
comfortable quarters where the shooting was
productive of smaller results, but more to my
taste. Jacksnipe, which were quite plentiful,
furnished an opportunity for skillful marksmanship,
but the high standard of economy
in using ammunition established for me by
Legrand was shamefully lowered. Jacksnipe
did not swarm before the muzzle of my gun,
nor was one bagged in every shot. This kind
of shooting is excellent for training the eye,
and no sportsman need be chagrined at an
occasional miss.

<h2 id="AN_OUTING_AT_TWO-OCEAN_PASS">AN OUTING AT TWO-OCEAN PASS</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">“Roughing it”</span> is an expression
which we have long associated with
various hardships undergone for the sake of
sport. But modern enterprise has made that
phrase a misnomer when taken in the sense in
which it was formerly understood. A number
of years’ experience in camping out and hunting
in the West have convinced me that every
reasonable comfort can be enjoyed without
sacrificing the principal object which lies
nearest the heart of a thorough sportsman&mdash;good
hunting.</p>

<p>The last outing I had in the West, was in
Wyoming, in the Jackson Hole country, and
I realized then how thoroughly a guide, who
enjoys the comforts of life himself and has
the real love of sport, can contribute to the
success of a hunting trip. A guide who likes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
to make himself comfortable will generally
think of what is necessary for the comfort of
those who engage his services.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">THE TETON RANGE.</p></div>

<p>Early in October I started out from St.
Anthony, Idaho, with my guide, Ed. Sheffield,
on one of the most pleasurable and successful
hunts I have undertaken. A couple of days’
drive and we reached Shives’ ranch, at which
place we made up the pack outfit. A short
rest at this spot while things were being got in
readiness was very pleasant, as it gave me a
chance to stretch my limbs and to admire the
grand perspective, which no words can describe
in a way that would bring the natural
picture to the eye. The Teton peaks, covered
with perpetual snow and dazzling bright,
furnished an attraction which never palled on
the mind, and they were ever visible from
the plain but tidy ranch. Flocks of ducks
frequented the ice cold stream near by.</p>

<p>The horses having been corralled during
the day’s wait, everything was arranged for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
the morning start. The next day I rose bright
and early to commence the final stage of the
journey. When the last pack had been
“cinched” and everything was in readiness,
we began our journey to the hunting grounds.
It was a long, monotonous ride&mdash;much of it
through thick timber with no stop for lunch
or rest, because the heavily laden beasts could
not lie down with their packs on, and we did
not care to delay them. At length, after
crossing a rocky ravine and a swift-running
stream and climbing a steep ascent, we arrived
at Two-Ocean Pass. There we found an
ideal spot to camp. In a short time everything
was unpacked, and the two tents were
pitched. The tired beasts that had borne the
brunt of the work tumbled over and rubbed
their backs in the dust and snorted with
delight.</p>

<p>The next morning I started out on horseback
with Sheffield, while the ranchman,
Shives, whom I had engaged as cook and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
general helper, remained behind and minded
camp. We took with us several dogs, because
they might be useful in rounding up lions or
“cats,” as they frequently call the cougar or
wildcats in that section. The day passed without
result, except that I lost my Seitz spy-glasses,
which hung on the pummel of my
saddle by a leather strap; this had evidently
caught on something and snapped. When the
guide heard of the loss, he exclaimed with
great confidence, “We must find them tomorrow.”
I was somewhat inclined to be
skeptical about his being able to recover the
lost property, but I assented to his going out
with a little dog he called Maiden, a cross of
a black-and-tan foxhound and a bloodhound,
as intelligent an animal as I ever saw. He
came back in a few hours with the glasses, and
I was curious to learn how he managed to
discover them. While following our trail
of the day before, he had stopped to call the
dog, which had fallen behind and stood yelping
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
at something which he had passed; upon
going to the spot, he found the glasses. They
were not immediately in the line of the trail,
but had rolled down hill and were some dozen
feet away from it. I wonder if that dog had
overheard our previous conversation and
knew what we wanted!</p>

<p>Although for a couple of weeks the weather
had been cool and exhilarating, often freezing
at night, still we had as yet no snow. Snow
was wanted, because it makes the hunting
good, and when traveling the impress of the
foot is practically noiseless, and does not
alarm the game. Moreover, when the snow
accumulates in deep drifts it drives the elk
and deer out of the higher elevations down
into the lower country, where they collect in
large numbers and become less shy.</p>

<p>One evening on the way back to camp the
guide was explaining to me why he thought
that we would be apt to find bull elk with the
best heads separated from the bunch of cow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
elk. The old bulls, it would seem, after a
time are driven off by the younger bulls,
which in turn take charge of the herds of
cow elk. The conversation was suddenly interrupted,
for on a knoll about 300 yards
distant, we saw two fine bulls all by themselves.
To dismount and take aim with my
Mauser after gauging the space, was a matter
of a few seconds. The furthest of the two bulls
was a stately monarch, and he had a set of
antlers which tempted me as much as a crown
could have tempted Cæsar. The first shot
fortunately took effect behind the shoulders
and made him sag on his knees, but he immediately
recovered and started to run. The
next shot was over him, and, before I could
fire again, the other bull ran in between and
blanketed him, receiving the ball. They
stood for several seconds in that position,
while two more messengers of death sang a
doleful dirge on their errand of destruction,
and they disappeared over the hill.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span></p>

<p>The atmosphere in that country is naturally
blue; but there was a tinge of blueness in
the air at that time which I am sure was not
natural. Sheffield said he was not the cause
of it, and I know that I was not to blame.
I have heard of somebody swearing until the
air became blue, but this does not seem to be
one of those cases.</p>

<p>However, we were both convinced that the
first bull was hit twice at least, and more than
likely would not go a great ways. It was
inexpedient to follow him up at that time,
because he was still fresh and strong. It
seemed best to go back to camp and come out
the next day and track him, because he would
be likely to run only a short distance, and
lying down to rest, would become stiff, and
incapable of running, in which case he could
be found in the morning. On the other hand,
if pursued, he might continue to run while
his strength held.</p>

<p>With anxious hearts we returned to camp,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
noting with apprehension the lowering clouds
that were beginning to darken the sky. The
indications of a storm which would cover the
ground with snow were not welcome now, as
much as I had desired it previously. Fresh
snow would conceal the tracks and destroy the
scent on the ground. If that should happen,
I had small expectation of securing my trophy.
The next morning the guide looked into my
tent, and said that everything was covered
with snow. I immediately went out to see
for myself. There, sure enough, it lay several
inches deep. It covered the trees, bending the
branches under their weight and transforming,
as if by magic, the rugged landscape into
a fairyland. It was beautiful&mdash;but it was
disappointing.</p>

<p>After breakfast we set out, taking one of
the dogs with us. When we reached the spot
where the elk had been shot the keen-scented
dog began to sniff the tops of the sage brush
which stood about two feet high. We followed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
him as he confidently pursued his way
through the sage brush and timber, until
finally, ascending a small knoll, I espied, just
over the crest, the tops of the antlers spread
out like the branches of a tree. The elk was
stretched out in beautiful repose, his neck
supported against a fallen tree, which held
up his antlers.</p>

<p>At last my trophy was won, and I had
something to show to admiring friends.</p>

<p>For the present the keen edge was taken
off my desire to kill, because I had something
to take back as a memento of the trip. A fine
trophy serves to identify most appropriately
a hunting experience, and as the years roll by
the memories of certain camps cluster about
each head and revive thrilling scenes which
might otherwise become dimmed amid an
uncongenial environment.</p>

<p>A considerable portion of my remaining
time I spent in easy life in camp. The meat
was a welcome addition to the larder and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
was much appreciated by the dogs. When
first killed, the flesh of the bull elk is not particularly
toothsome; it should be allowed to
hang for a time until it becomes tender.</p>

<p>It was an entertaining sight to see the dogs
catch the large hunks of meat flung to them,
which they often swallowed without masticating
it, unless one or two bites could be exaggerated
into an act of mastication. When
hunger was appeased to the extent of a surfeit,
the cunning animals would still continue
to accept gifts of raw meat, which they would
carefully cache in some favorite spot. Each
dog knew where he had cached his own supplies,
and expected every other dog to respect
it. Occasional disputes arose among them, but&mdash;though
with a bad grace&mdash;the dog with a
guilty conscience generally yielded when detected
in the act of violating the law which
holds a cache sacred among dogs as among
men.</p>

<p>There are certain very simple and rudimentary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
laws which the primitive life
develops. The rule that the cache shall
remain inviolate is well known. The absence
of adequate protection for a cache beyond its
secrecy, which is not always sufficient, makes
it a point of honor among the rough denizens
of the wilderness to respect property so deposited.
In a primitive state of society, when
recourse to such means of providing for
emergency were more frequent, the frontier
man was likely to regard as worthy of death
any one who violated this law.</p>

<p>When I read of the ruthless slaughter
which has been wrought among the elk, especially
by the detestable tooth-hunter, I recall,
with some degree of satisfaction, the forbearance
which I exercised upon various occasions.
One evening, while returning to camp,
I saw in the waning light, about the space of
three hundred and fifty yards removed from
where I stood, three bull elk standing on the
side of a hill, their forms fairly well defined
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
against the white background which the snow
afforded. The antlers were less distinct on
account of the deadening effect of some spruce
trees, whose branches reached below the
spread of the antlers. I wanted another
trophy, but was uncertain about the quality
of any one of the heads in sight. Although I
watched the bulls for some time, while they
remained practically without motion, I was
unable to make sure that there was a really
first-class head in the bunch. I finally gave
them the benefit of the doubt. If I made a
mistake, I have the satisfaction of knowing
that I erred on the right side.</p>

<p>The time arrived for breaking up camp.
When the horses were packed, the guide and
myself separated from the rest of the outfit,
in order to secure better hunting. We had not
traveled far, when one of the dogs stopped
and growled. We both reined up, while I
dismounted and approached the edge of a
clearing just ahead. Across the clearing some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
eighty or ninety yards distant I saw a brown
body disappearing amid the spruces. Aiming
at the spot where the shoulder should be,
concealed by the forest growth, a trifle in advance
of the brown, which I recognized as
the belly of the elk, I fired. Stunned by the
bullet, the animal broke into another opening,
when I emptied my magazine, which contained
several additional cartridges. Fortunately
the animal turned out to be a bull
elk with a fairly good spread. I should not
have taken the chance except that my hunting
for this season was practically over, and I
had not shot my full allowance. Having
dressed the animal so as to keep its meat from
spoiling, we left everything and followed the
outfit. Shives was sent back with a pack
horse to get the meat and the antlers.</p>

<p>At the Shives ranch a hearty welcome was
given us. Mrs. Shives proved herself an
admirable hostess. I shall never forget the
repast specially prepared for us by which she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
proved herself an accomplished cook. One
dish I approached with misgiving, for I could
not guess what it was. I discovered in it a
culinary gem which in my judgment will hold
its own with anything ever prepared by the
most accomplished chef to please a capricious
palate&mdash;elk’s brain scrambled in eggs. My
cup of happiness was filled to the brim, but
the guide caused it to run over when he presented
me with a pair of untanned cow skin
shaps marked with red and white spots, which
he wore when dressed up to have his picture
taken in correct style.

<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="CAMP_LIFE_NEAR_THE_TETONS">CAMP LIFE NEAR THE TETONS</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">One</span> of the most picturesque sections of
our country lies in the valleys and depressions
formed by the Gallatin River where
it winds its way among the rugged mountains
of Montana. Sometimes the river steals
noiselessly through level spots, forming great
pools of clear greenish water, where the big
rainbow trout love to bask in the sunshine
which the gamy fish love for its brightness
more than its warmth. Frequently the
stream challenges the obstructions of masses
of rock, forcing its way with angry murmurs
to its destination. Amid such scenes I fell
into repose, while sitting near a large camp-fire,
yielding to the heaviness due to a hearty
meal and a long day’s travel on horseback.</p>

<p>I do not remember how I managed to
make up my rustic bed, or whether I had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
anything to do with it at all. I simply recall
the quiet scenes around the camp-fire, the
ruddy faces of my companions as they caught
the glow from the burning fagots and the
wild scene which surrounded us. I entered
dreamland in the same way everyone else
does. The unreal realm of fancy I accepted
as a matter of course, but when the chill of
a cold autumn night gradually revived me
to consciousness and the sullen gloom of the
silent forest, only broken by a murmuring
stream nearby, had succeeded the cheerful
camp-fire, I returned to the world of reality
with a feeling of strangeness and wonder. I
rubbed my eyes to make sure if I was really
awake, and lay watching the stars shining
brightly overhead. The beauty of the night,
however, was not sufficient to keep me awake,
and when I had finished my night’s rest it
was broad daylight, and my two companions,
Jake and Aleck, were already astir. Aleck was
the cook and general handy man about camp.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
Jake acted as guide and horse wrangler.
These men could take a turn at helping each
other, but each had his special work cut out
for him. In packing and pitching tents they
were mutually helpful. Whenever things
went wrong and descriptive language was
required to soothe irritated feelings, their
common desire to aid each other developed
into a generous rivalry. Aleck was busy
getting breakfast ready, but the other man
was not in sight.</p>

<p>“Where is Jake?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Gone after the horses,” Aleck answered.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose they are gone far?”</p>

<p>“Oh, maybe a mile, maybe fifteen,” was
the enlightening response.</p>

<p>When camping out in the Western country
horses are an uncertain quantity. They are
apt to wander over a considerable space in
search of good pasturage, which is not easy
to find on account of the extreme dryness of
the soil and the difficulty of any vegetation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
thriving which cannot shoot its roots deep
into the earth. Fortunately Jake soon appeared
with the stock.</p>

<p>“We will have the tents up so that you
can be comfortable to-night,” he remarked
with a look as though he were conveying a
most welcome piece of intelligence, for we
had been sleeping out in the open for several
nights.</p>

<p>With the air of one who despised all such
things as enervating luxuries, I replied:
“Let that go to some other time; we want
to get an early start after something.”</p>

<p>“It won’t take long to put up the tents and
then Aleck can get everything else to rights
while we are hunting,” Jake replied.</p>

<p>I ate a substantial breakfast, and after
finishing that meal I ate a substantial lunch
before starting. Needless to say, I felt in
no condition for vigorous exercise which I
would be compelled to take when our course
led over ascents too steep to take on horseback.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
About lunch time, however, my
capricious and unreasoning stomach, like
some people who are mere slaves of custom
and routine, demanded a square meal, which
was not to be had.</p>

<p>Two dogs, which served more as sociable
companions about camp than in any other
capacity, accompanied us. One of the dogs
was a large-sized bull-terrier, rather old and
at times inclined to be cross. This animal
answered to the name of Major. Major had
a peculiar trait, which it is hard to account
for. In the evening, when the cook pulled
out his harmonicon and began to perform
on it, Major would stick his nose straight up
in the air and emit the most doleful and
lugubrious wail I ever listened to.</p>

<p>The other dog was a fox-terrier, named
Jack, like most of his species, a very animated
little creature, always ready for a scrap.
This disposition was a source of annoyance
at times, because Jack had a strong prejudice
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
against porcupines, and on several occasions
I have had to sit on the ground and help pull
the quills out of his hide after one of these
encounters.</p>

<p>As I was leisurely riding along some distance
behind the guide I saw him stop on a
slight elevation somewhat in advance, and
at the same time I heard the dogs barking
very savagely. Jake made a sign to me to
hurry up. When I arrived at the spot I saw
a couple of coyotes not more than forty yards
away yelping and tantalizing the dogs. I
dismounted, after pulling my rifle out of its
scabbard, and brought it carelessly to my
shoulder. Jake in the meantime had unsheathed
his knife ready to strip the hides.</p>

<p>I fired, and, much to my surprise, both of
the coyotes vanished with startling suddenness.
I had evidently missed, probably overshooting.
I think it was about the worst
shot I ever made, and I never could understand
it. A sportsman will once in a while
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
flinch through some muscular contraction
which it is hard to account for. The thick
sage brush and intervening hills made a
second shot practically hopeless. Jake
seemed overcome with emotion, quite as
much as myself. For once his eloquent
tongue failed him; the words appeared to
stick in his throat. His wide open eyes and
his distended jaws, which seemed to be pried
open with a quid of tobacco in one corner of
his mouth, betrayed his astonishment. In
silence we remounted and rode a considerable
space without speaking a word.</p>

<p>Finally Jake opened the conversation with
all the tact of an accomplished diplomat.</p>

<p>Turning in his saddle and looking intently
at me he exclaimed: “Say, do you know
what I would do if I missed a shot like that?”</p>

<p>“No,” I replied.</p>

<p>“I would take that gun and smash it over
the first rock I came across.”</p>

<p>I quite agreed with him that it was the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
fault of the gun, but, strange to say, I did
not take his advice. I still have the weapon
and I can recall some of its achievements,
which are not wholly discreditable.</p>

<p>Several days passed quite uneventfully
except for a rather novel experience. While
sitting around the camp-fire one evening our
attention was attracted by the noise of some
animal breaking through the undergrowth.
The sound of cracking branches and pattering
hoofs seemed to approach closer.</p>

<p>“That’s one of the horses, and he seems
inclined to be sociable,” said Jake as he
leaned over to lay hold of a good-sized stick
to cast at him.</p>

<p>The animal presently appeared, coming
straight to the camp-fire, but when fairly
revealed by the light the horse we were about
to drive unceremoniously away developed a
splendid set of antlers. We were confronted
by a black-tailed deer which had been
attracted by the strange fascination of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
blaze to within several paces, where he stood
perfectly still. No one moved nor uttered
a word for a considerable space for fear of
alarming our timid guest. It was a charming
sight to watch the graceful and shapely
form of the deer, his head crowned with a
perfectly balanced set of antlers, the wide
open eyes staring in bewilderment at three
rough looking men sitting around the fire like
petrified images. The deer held his position
for some thirty seconds rigid and immovable,
except the swelling of his sides in breathing,
while the glowing embers brought out in
distinct view every line and muscle of the
body against the dark background of the
forest.</p>

<p>He posed like a beautiful statue with all
the advantage of picturesque and weird surroundings
to set off his perfect figure.</p>

<p>What a chance for a photographer to take
a snapshot of the group with a flashlight.
Sad to relate, the only impression I could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
take away with me was that which was
photographed upon my mind. In place of
a photograph to show to my friends I am
compelled to relate the bare circumstance
with but limited power to portray the scene
in words; the imagination of the reader must
do the rest.</p>

<p>How long the tableau would have lasted
I cannot say, if I had not pulled the curtain,
so to speak, by attempting to reach out and
get my rifle, which was nearby. I knew it
was a desperate chance, but I was extremely
anxious to secure the head of our handsome
guest.</p>

<p>Hardly had I attempted to move my hand
in the direction of the rifle, although very
slowly, than the watchful eyes seemed to become
conscious of something wrong, and the
spell was broken. With a single leap the
deer cleared the lighted space and was lost
in the darkness of the forest.</p>

<p>It is a well known fact that wild animals
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
and birds are stupefied at the appearance of
artificial light. Birds are often attracted by
it, while animals, dazed by the strangeness
of the sight and the glare, seem to lose at
times all power of motion. Whether it is
because of curiosity or on account of the
judgment becoming paralyzed through excessive
fear, artificial light of great intensity
seems to deprive a wild animal of his usual
cunning and alertness. Wildfowl, such as
ducks and geese, are notably affected in the
same way. “Firelighting,” which it is well
known, involves the destruction of so many
thousands of game birds every year, fairly
illustrates and proves the foregoing statement.
Insects seem strangely attracted by
artificial lights and frequently pay for their
temerity with their lives. What impression
artificial light makes upon wild animals it is
hard to state. Sportsmen know how easily
a deer can be taken at a disadvantage by
“jacking,” but this does not account for one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
entering the lighted circle of a camp-fire.
Instances of wild animals being approached
when stupefied by the presence of artificial
light are plentiful, but I have never known
before of any animal actually invading a
camp and standing in front of the fire.</p>

<p>When we had exhausted comment upon
the unusual incident, which was the absorbing
theme for conversation for the balance of
the evening, a good night’s sleep came as
relaxation from the exercise of the day.</p>

<p>The morning broke bright and clear and
quite cold. Breakfast was soon bolted down.
An abomination which Aleck called a pancake
was the principal article of our repast.
This dish compensated by its size and quantity
for what it lacked in other respects. Even
Jake, whose digestion might excite the envy
of an ostrich, hesitated before tackling a
second one. Aleck, seeing his uncertain look,
asked him whether he would have another
pancake.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span></p>

<p>“Only a small piece about the size of your
foot,” Jake replied.</p>

<p>Having saddled the horses the guide took
a course which led along a rocky defile for
a considerable distance. While looking up
at the red sandstone cliffs, which overhung
us, and admiring the contrast their rugged
outlines furnished against the clear blue of
the sky, I saw a large bald-headed eagle
perched upon a commanding eminence. His
figure was sharply defined in the clear atmosphere,
and although I knew he was quite a
distance off, I was somewhat surprised when
the guide computed the range at 300 yards
at least. I reined up my horse and threw
the lines over his head. As Jake saw me
alight to take aim, a sort of weary expression
came over his face. He was evidently thinking
of the coyotes. After carefully sighting
the bird and gauging the range according to
the estimate I had received, I fired. For
several seconds the wings fluttered, as the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
eagle strove to balance himself on his perch,
and then he collapsed in a lifeless mass, a
few feet below.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i109" src="images/i109.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A GLIMPSE OF ROCKY MOUNTAIN SCENERY.</p></div>

<p>Having watched the lifeless shape a few
seconds, I reloaded the rifle without betraying
any signs of emotion or uttering a word.
Although my eyes were turned in a different
direction, I felt conscious of a penetrating
gaze which seemed to go through me like an
X-ray and read my inmost thought. Turning
to mount my horse, I met the wide-open
eyes of Jake staring at me in astonishment.
Neither of us said a word for some time, but
Jake was thinking, wondering whether it was
an accident or a fair exhibition of my skill.
The only data he had to work on in drawing
his conclusions was the previous bad marksmanship
in shooting at the coyotes, and the
telling recent shot at the eagle, which I
seemed to regard as a matter of course, but
I acted the same way when I missed the
coyotes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span></p>

<p>Jake displayed the same resourcefulness
that a curious woman will sometimes exercise
upon receiving a letter: first she looks at
the post-mark, then at the handwriting of
the address and, after exhausting all the pros
and cons to determine what the contents of
the letter are, finally strikes upon a happy
idea&mdash;she opens the letter and reads it.
After Jake had thoroughly turned the incident
over in his mind he finally remarked,
in a tone pitched between an exclamation
and an interrogation point: “I guess you
were surprised when you fetched that bird
down?” My presence of mind did not leave
me; I gave Jake good advice about marksmanship
and shooting in general. He
thanked me and said he hoped I would give
him some points about guiding and outfitting,
as he was trying to learn the business.</p>

<p>Game being rather scarce in this section
we concluded to move camp and try our luck
in the Jackson’s Hole country. For a short
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
time I made headquarters near a ranch on
Jackson’s Lake. This body of water is
situated quite close to the Grand Tetons,
which tower thousands of feet above its surface.
The crest of these great formations,
like a mighty arm stretching a curtain over
the western sky, receives the rays of the morning
sun long before they reach the narrow
valley below. It is interesting and beautiful
to see the golden light slowly creeping down
the slopes of these great mountains, until at
last the sun, having climbed well into the
sky, suddenly pours its golden flood of light
in one immense deluge into the lake. The
transition is startling.</p>

<p>The trout in the lake grow to a very large
size and are very gamy. There are a few
hot springs in this locality which, however,
do not affect the temperature of the water,
which is very cold the year round. The lake
derives its main supply from the melting
snows of the surrounding mountains.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

<p>I concluded to enjoy a morning’s sport
fishing, and for that purpose secured a boat
from the ranchman who threw in his services
as well. We poled up the outlet, which was
a very clear and swift stream. The trout
swarmed under the boat at times in great
numbers and many of them of considerable
size. Flocks of wild ducks and geese, winging
their way to their feeding grounds, broke
the stillness of the early morning, for it was
before daybreak that we started, when the
stars were beginning to pale in the sky. The
trout made their presence quite noticeable,
frequently disturbing the surface of the
water, and sometimes a big one would stir
up an awful commotion. I soon had a seven-pound
trout securely hooked, which I landed
as soon as I was able to do so, because I
wanted a change of diet.</p>

<p>Although I had been in camp for a couple
of weeks I had been unable to get a shot at
an elk, and had only seen one making its way
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
through the thick timber. The snow had not
fallen as yet, and the ground was very dry,
which made hunting difficult. It was a welcome
sight one morning to look out of my
tent and see the ground covered with snow,
and it is, moreover, surprising to notice what
a difference it makes in hunting. I had not
traveled more than two miles from camp on
foot when I heard a long, loud whistle&mdash;a
most pleasing sound. I directed my steps in
the direction whence it came, and was rewarded
by catching a glimpse of half a dozen
elk disappearing through an opening in the
timber. They were not going fast, and I
do not believe they saw me.</p>

<p>I followed them as quickly and carefully
as I could until I came to the edge of a steep
descent, and saw the bunch in the valley
below. In the herd there was a fine bull
who seemed proud of his authority, and
occasionally whistled and bugled his challenge
to any possible rival disposed to dispute
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
his lordship over the cows he had assembled
around him, which by this time had considerably
increased in numbers. The distance
seemed too great to hazard a shot, and I
thought I would circle around on the higher
elevations to secure a closer range and better
position. Although unfrightened, the elk
began to move off with a gentle ambling gait
which seems slow, but if one tries to keep up
with it in a rough mountainous country he
will find his energy pretty well taxed. I soon
lost sight of the game and stopped partly
because I was almost exhausted and also to
locate the herd, if it were possible to hear it.</p>

<p>At first I thought I heard the hoof beats
on the ground, but presently recognized that
it was the action of my heart, which was beating
so forcibly that I could distinctly hear
it. The high elevation and the vigorous
exercise often produce that effect upon one
who is not used to the climate. Other sportsmen
have had a similar experience. After
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
pursuing my course some distance along the
side of a steep hill my attention was suddenly
arrested by the sound of breaking branches
in the spruce nearby. I had not long to wait
before a spike-horned elk stepped out in
front of me not more than twenty-five or
thirty yards off. The large brown eyes were
looking straight at me with a mildness and
apparent absence of fear, which removed all
thought of slaughter from my mind, although
at that time I had never killed an elk.</p>

<p>The poor quality of the head as a trophy
determined my action. After gazing a few
seconds I turned my steps in the direction I
thought the herd had taken its course. A
long, shrill whistle, ending in a squeal,
blended with a bray like a donkey, soon informed
me of the whereabouts of the bull I
was seeking. Climbing over the crest of the
hill I finally caught sight of the old bull in
the valley with a bunch of cow elk collected
around him, which had increased by this time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
to about twenty-five or thirty. The bull
frequently threw his head up, giving vent
to his peculiar call, which was answered now
and then by several other bulls on the surrounding
hills, none of which seemed willing
to venture near him. I watched this
spectacle for some time, endeavoring to get
near enough to obtain a good shot.</p>

<p>Being alone and unaccustomed to the
country I was unable to gauge the distance
correctly. When finally I stopped at the
nearest point I could reach to secure a fair
shot (I was using on that occasion a .45-90
Winchester, not one of the modern high-power
guns with a flat trajectory), I fired
at the bull without effect and saw the whole
bunch of cow elk come together in a solid
mass and ascend the slope of the neighboring
mountain. The cow elk acted as though
panic-stricken, all striving to get as near the
center of the bunch as possible while ascending
the slope and interfering considerably
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
with the movements of one another in so
doing. The bull remained behind until the
cows had gained a considerable start, and
then followed them up the mountain. When
I examined the distance from the spot where
I stood when I fired at the bull to the point
where he was located, I found it over 400
yards. Being unaccustomed to gauging distance
at that time, I underestimated the range.
The atmosphere is so clear that objects obtain
a much clearer definition and seem at times
nearer than they really are. A mistake in
underestimating distance made a greater difference
with the old .45-90 than it would
with modern high power rifles. I returned
to camp burning with a desire to secure a
good trophy.</p>

<p>The next day I went out with Jake. We
separated, agreeing to meet at a certain
place, which, through some misunderstanding,
we failed to accomplish. I soon ran
upon the tracks of a big bull elk, which led
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
directly up the steep side of a mountain.
This I climbed for about six hundred feet
with some trouble, when I noticed that the
tracks had begun to turn and tended downward.
I continued to follow them until they
brought me again to the foot of the mountain,
within about thirty feet of the point
where I first started to trace them up. I
finally ran across my guide again, and it was
not long before his keen eyes picked out an
elk at a distance of about two hundred and
fifty yards, just visible among some spruce
trees. It was a cow elk, and I was indisposed
to shoot it, but being reminded of the
condition of the larder I concluded to try my
luck. The crack of the rifle was followed
by the disappearance of the animal in the
timber, and I thought I had missed, but was
reassured to the contrary, and when I reached
the spot where the elk had stood I saw a few
traces of blood, which shortly led to a brown
form lying among the green spruce trees&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
elk was stone dead. Standing over Jake,
who was engaged in dressing the elk, I asked
him if he thought I ought to smash the rifle
over a rock. Looking up from his dirty
work, besmeared with perspiration and gore,
he replied with a grin, “Not when she throws
lead like that.”</p>

<p>My time was drawing to a close, and
although I had abundant opportunities to kill
animals with inferior heads, that kind of
sport did not satisfy me, and I left them to
die a natural death, unless some tooth hunter
has cut their existence short.</p>

<p>The final day passed without result, and I
had to leave for a later period a more successful
hunt for trophies.</p>

<p>The last night around the camp-fire Jake
made entertaining by relating to me some of
his personal experiences. The following
story was told me as absolutely true: The
guide had struck the trail of a mountain lion,
which he followed with his pack of dogs to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
a tree where the trail ended. Naturally he
expected to find the lion in the tree. Much
to his surprise there was no lion in the tree,
and no tracks of a lion leading away from the
tree. The only tracks discernible were the
tracks of an elk. Finally a bloodhound in
the pack started off on the elk tracks. This
seemed very strange, because the dogs had
been thoroughly broken from following anything
except lions and bobcats. The guide
tried to call the dog back, but he continued
to follow the elk tracks, and the rest of the
pack joined in the pursuit. Following the
tracks about a quarter of a mile, there appeared
in the snow signs of a struggle, and
then an impression upon the ground of a
large animal which the elk had evidently unseated.
The lion’s tracks were distinctly
visible from this point for a considerable
distance, until he took refuge in a pinyon
tree.</p>

<p>It was plain that the mountain lion had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
jumped upon the back of a passing elk and
had stolen a free ride, which he enjoyed until
his saddle horse dismounted him. “That
shows what a wonderfully intelligent animal
a dog is,” said Jake; “just to think that they
should have reasoned it out that the lion had
ridden off on the elk, when I was puzzled
myself to find out what had become of him.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i120" src="images/i120.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PACK HORSES ROUNDED UP FOR THE RETURN.</p></div>

<p>“Do you suppose,” chimed in Aleck, “that
the dogs showed intelligence because they
knew more than you did?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span></p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="BLOODLESS_SPORT">BLOODLESS SPORT</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">There</span> has developed in recent years a
sentiment which has declared itself
strongly in opposition to taking animal life
for the sake of sport. The camera has been
recommended as a substitute for the death-dealing
firearm. A great many people have
discussed this subject without possessing a
clear idea of what constitutes real sport.</p>

<p>To obtain a better understanding of the
subject we may classify those who hunt for
the purpose of destroying wild life under
three divisions: sportsmen, market hunters
and butchers. The last expression I have
employed in a peculiar sense as indicating a
very objectionable class in itself. By a process
of elimination one may arrive at the true
conception of a sportsman after first grasping
the meaning of the term market hunter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
and butcher, and then disabusing the mind of
both of those conceptions. The term butcher
is applicable to whomever engages in the
wanton and wasteful destruction of animal
life with no idea of utilizing the remains.
To the mind of such persons a sportsman’s
goal is a slaughter pen. The game butcher
recognizes no rules, but prides himself on
the amount of havoc he can produce in a
flock of birds or a herd of wild animals, and
speaks with glee of the quantity of game he
has destroyed. The market hunter, as the
name implies, is out for business. The rules
of sport do not interest him; it is merely a
question of dollars and cents; he kills when
it pays to kill, and tries to make certain every
shot, regarding any advantage he can take as
perfectly legitimate. The worst qualities of
the butcher and the market hunter combine
in the person who hunts elk for the purpose
of securing the teeth, allowing the antlers
and carcass to remain unused. The sins of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
these two classes are indiscriminately laid on
the shoulders of the sportsman by people who
have a misty idea about real sport.</p>

<p>The desire to kill is instinctive, and, refined
under civilizing influences, produces the
sportsman. The mere love of killing for the
sake of doing so soon palled on people who
had any conception of sport. The true theory
of sport, whether in playing games or in hunting,
necessarily involves the idea of a contest
or trial of skill wherein there is a certain
element of chance. The rapid destruction of
game, consequent upon the easy mastery of
nature by man, led in quite early times to the
establishment of game preserves and the enactment
of laws for the preservation of game.
The killing of game developed into a pastime,
and rules regulating its enjoyment readily
grew out of this method of recreation. In
other words it came to be regarded as a sport
or game wherein the hunted had rights or
privileges which had to be respected the same
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
as those of a contestant in any other game;
the huntsman must exercise his ingenuity and
sometimes his daring and endurance against
the cunning and desperation of the wild
beast. It is obvious from the foregoing explanation
that no sportsman countenances
killing, except for a purpose, and prefers to
give the game a chance to exercise its cleverness
and adroitness in making good its escape;
if it fails, it has been outwitted. The observance
of game laws for the preservation of
game find no stronger advocates anywhere
than among sportsmen, and it is to their interest
to prevent the extermination of wild
life, because if that should take place their
pastime would be gone.</p>

<p>There are a number of enlightened people,
however, who distinctly disapprove of a
sportsman’s favorite amusement and regard
hunting and killing game for recreation as
altogether wrong. An examination into this
state of feeling with a view of ascertaining
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
whether it is based upon a clearly defined
reason, or is merely a capricious sentiment,
may be instructive. All animal life in one way
or another exists or is sacrificed for the benefit
of humanity. No one can reasonably
combat this assertion. By the very instinct
of his being, man assumes to have an unquestioned
right to subject the lower order of
created life to his use. This assertion of his
authority dates from the beginning when the
fiat was delivered&mdash;“Let him have dominion
over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl
of the air, and over every living thing that
moveth upon the face of the earth!” In
what way shall this authority be exercised?
Human necessity or convenience alone has
determined that question without the brute
creation being considered. The beast that is
reduced to servitude, and compelled to work
the balance of his existence, finds no advocate
for his emancipation; no protest is made
against the wholesale slaughter of cattle to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
supply the meat market. But when the
sportsman goes forth to exercise his skill,
allowing the hunted prey a chance for its life
and freedom, the sentimentalist, who is generally
someone who never took pleasure in
that form of amusement, throws up his hands
and exclaims, “How brutal!” It is easy to
discriminate against a practice in which one
does not participate. Self-denial, when you
deny yourself nothing, is an easy and convenient
morality. The brute creation is sacrificed
for man’s enjoyment, and it is useless
to offer capricious objections to a form of
sacrifice which pleases another and which
does not happen to appeal to one’s own idea
of pleasure.</p>

<p>There is a great deal of inconsistency displayed
by many who deprecate hunting with
a rifle or shotgun, as the case may be. Cruelty
to animals seems to include birds and quadrupeds,
but not fish. I have heard people
who are fond of angling expatiate upon the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
wickedness of destroying animal life; yet they
saw no harm in catching fish with a light rod
and play their quarry for a long time.</p>

<p>The huntsman endeavors to kill his game
as soon as possible; he does not prolong its
agony for his amusement. No protests are
made against fishing as a sport so far as I
have observed. The reason for this is not
hard to discover. The fish is a cold-blooded
creature to whom the heart does not seem to
go out in sympathy to any extent; the slimy
scales do not invite the contact of the fingers
like the warm fur of a deer or the soft down
of a duck; there is nothing in its “yellow
orbs” to excite sentimental regard; it is not
an object one would pet or fondle like a
spotted fawn; wanting in qualities which
appeal to the fancy, no plea is set up in its
behalf. In further evidence of the inconsistency
in question I have heard ladies almost
melt with emotion while deprecating the destruction
of animal life by the sportsman, who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
yet seem little affected by the recital of the
lingering death agony of the poor creatures
caught in traps to furnish the furs which
minister to female vanity.</p>

<p>The universal custom of sacrificing animal
life in some form or another makes it impossible
for one to condemn the sportsman’s
method of destroying it without the charge
of inconsistency. Once concede that the right
to take the life of dumb creatures exists, and
the individual must decide in what way that
right shall be exercised, with the limitations
which civilization places upon the exercise of
all natural rights.

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">We</span> read of the big game which once
frequented the Western part of the
United States in such large numbers; yet in
traveling over that section in a Pullman it
is surprising that we seldom see any evidence
of it. Leaving the line of the railway and
settlement, the monotony of the sterile plain
covered with sagebrush is unrelieved by signs
of animal life, except horses and cattle and
occasionally herds of sheep. The old life
has passed and the new has hardly developed
sufficiently to supply its place.</p>

<p>Here and there may be found spots which
excite the ardor of sportsmen, but they are
generally inaccessible except through the
agency of a competent guide. The great
herds of buffalo which once swept over the
plains in such vast numbers as to endanger
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
the life of the pioneer, have disappeared
entirely; the elk have almost vanished and
their annual migrations have ceased to be a
terror to the ranchman, who fenced in his
hay to protect it from the famished herds.
Even the smaller game has greatly diminished.</p>

<p class="caption">When the ascent is steep and slippery, one is aided by holding on to a horse’s tail.</p></div>

<p>There are yet some localities where
primeval conditions still continue to a great
extent; of these the most noted is the country
south of the Yellowstone National Park.
To the providential care of the National
Government, in laying out this great preserve,
is due the preservation of the principal
sport which now remains. Large bands of
elk frequent this preserve during the greater
part of the year, until the heavy snows drive
them down from the higher elevations to
obtain pasturage. Other game besides elk
may be hunted in the country adjacent to the
park, such as sheep, antelope and blacktail
deer, besides smaller animals. With a pack
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
of well trained dogs it is also possible to hunt
with success cougars, bobcats, lynx and sometimes
bear. Elk and deer do not, as a rule,
frequent the same locality to any extent. If
one desires to hunt sheep and goats a still
different plan of operation must be adopted,
while antelope inhabit a country where neither
elk, deer, sheep, nor goats are likely to be
found, except by merest accident.</p>

<p>The time when a sportsman could pitch
his tent most anywhere and expect the wild
animal life of forest and plain to come to
him as they came to Adam when he first
named them, has long since vanished. To
hunt with success one must be thoroughly
versed in woodcraft, be possessed of a good
knowledge of the habits of game and the
localities where they are to be found at different
seasons of the year, have a quick eye to
pick out a desirable head, and must be a reasonably
fair judge of distance, to gauge the
proper elevation of a rifle. The happy combination
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
of these qualities make the skilled
hunter; marksmanship, provided it be fair,
is the least important of all his qualifications.
There are a great many men who are good
shots at a stationary target who are bad shots
at game; there are men who are good shots
at game, who are by no means experts in
shooting at a mark. This statement may
seem paradoxical but readily admits of explanation.
The marksman has his range
given him, he takes his time, and is not betrayed
into sudden action. Change these
conditions and he is out of his element. If
his eye is not trained to judge distance in
timber or on the plain, he can easily misgauge
it, and shooting at a moving object
he cannot take his time; the absence of any
spot on the animal near the point he is aiming
at is another disadvantage to the man of
the target. The practiced hunter knows his
distance; his keen eye readily distinguishes
his quarry, although it may blend with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
landscape, so that the unpracticed eye might
easily overlook it; he is accustomed to take
a quick sight and shoot, making proper allowances
for the moving object; if a rapid
advance is possible and necessary to cut off
the game before it can pass a given point
for which it is heading, the hunter chooses
his course, as if by intuition, and often has
a chance to get several more shots where
another would fail of his opportunity. The
skill of a hunter generally brings him within
such proximity of game as to relieve him of
the necessity of making an extra difficult shot.
It is surprising how seldom the huntsman discharges
his rifle compared to one who practices
at a target. The man who is fond of
target practice will probably use up as many
rounds of ammunition in one afternoon shooting
at a mark as the average huntsman will
consume in an entire year.</p>

<p>A sportsman who is a fair shot, and who
goes to a locality where game is fairly plentiful,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
has every reason in the world to expect
success, provided he is accompanied by a real
hunter, such an one as I have above described.
It is very important to employ a competent
guide if one expects a successful hunt. When
I speak of a competent guide I mean a man
who is a good hunter and also capable of
managing a hunting outfit.</p>

<p>Guides may be divided into three classes:</p>

<p>(1) Ordinary frauds who are watching
an opportunity to “work” some “dude,” by
which name sportsmen are sometimes designated
in the slang of the country.</p>

<p>(2) Backwoodsmen who are good hunters
and tireless and will supply a sportsman
with the best they know how to provide, but
being ignorant of the ordinary comforts of
civilized life, treat their sportsmen with the
same cruel neglect to which they have accustomed
themselves.</p>

<p>(3) The man who makes a regular business
of acting as a guide, who is a good
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
hunter and who also knows how to provide
a first-class outfit.</p>

<p>Game has greatly decreased before the
advance of civilization and the wanton
slaughter which took no thought of the
future; the wild life which survives owes its
preservation to the almost inaccessible character
of the country in which it has taken
refuge, and to its own cunning, which of
necessity has become very acute.</p>

<p>To know the habitat of game and outwit
its wariness requires the skill of the practiced
hunter.</p>

<p>We have heard a great deal about roughing
it. That phrase as formerly understood
must be greatly qualified if the modern
sportsman patronizes an up-to-date outfit.</p>

<p>Going to a wild and rather inaccessible
country has about it a certain charm of
novelty, and part of that charm grows out of
the idea of roughing it. Some people have a
tendency to greatly exaggerate the ordeals
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
through which they pass in order that they
may enhance the interest of their experience.
This goes with the weakness for overstating
the distance and increasing the apparent
difficulty of the shots which they make in
securing their trophies, in which error they
are too frequently sustained by the somewhat
elastic conscience of the guide. This is an
age of progress, and that phrase applies to
methods of enjoying sport quite as well as
it does to anything else. Having good sport
with comfort in camp life is simply a question
of dollars and cents. The average person
does not understand the present conditions
of sporting life in a wild country.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that in traveling
in rough sections of the West, where big
game still abounds, although in much smaller
numbers than formerly, everything has to be
carried on pack horses. What you are to
take is limited simply by the supply of pack
horses you are to engage. In an up-to-date
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
outfit the open camp-fire, such a picturesque
feature in an illustration, has been supplanted
by a plain sheet-iron stove which is placed in
the tent, with a few feet of pipe attached to
carry off the smoke. If one wants the open
fire it of course can be easily supplied, and
at first a good many sportsmen desire it on
account of the romance and novelty of the
experience, but the same pampered tastes,
which have forced man from a savage life
to adopt the comforts which civilization
supplies, will invariably lead to the open
camp-fire being abandoned for the commonplace
sheet-iron stove&mdash;very unromantic but
thoroughly practical and useful. The open
camp-fire, with the smoke blowing in your
eyes from every direction, which gives the
sensation of being scorched on one side and
frozen on the other, does not appeal to the
modern sportsman who disassociates sport
from martyrdom.</p>

<p>Folding tables and chairs can be “packed”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
quite easily, and it is much pleasanter to sit
in a chair and eat off of a table than to sit
on a log trying to make a table of your knees,
and occasionally converting your lap into a
plate for your spilled victuals. A portable
rubber bathtub, if one objects to jumping
into cold water, satisfies the desire for
cleanliness. With a fire in the stove one can
take a bath as easily and comfortably in camp
as at home. For thorough cleansing it is
best for one to take a bath in a tent in warm
water, but I strongly recommend to those
who can stand it a plunge in cold water or
being soused with a bucket or two every
morning before dressing for the day. This
stimulates the body and gets the system in
fine condition.</p>

<p>For those who find it uncomfortable to
sleep on the hard surface of the ground I
would recommend a pneumatic mattress. An
ample supply of canned stuff insures against
the chance of bad cooking, because it requires
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
little or no skill to prepare canned provisions,
if the other food in camp is not particularly
appetizing.</p>

<p>This article is not intended for the experienced
hunter who has had plenty of
experience of Western hunting; nor is it
intended for the man who has his heart set
upon roughing it in the sense that he desires
to see how much he can go through and
survive. A great deal of the advice given
to people has been in the opposite direction,
namely, to cut out as much as possible from
their hunting outfit. I claim that the average
person who desires sport with as little hardship
as possible, except what is unavoidable,
should be very careful about reducing his
outfit too much. Most sportsmen are accustomed
to the ordinary comforts and conveniences
of life. It is perfect folly for
such people to attempt in a short time to
harden themselves to the frontier life so
they may endure its hardships with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
same indifference as the hunter or trapper
who lives that way all the time. I have run
across sportsmen who have had their hunting
trips spoiled by attempting to rough it too
much. If you are accustomed to living well
and in comfort, it would be wise to recognize
the fact that you are a “tenderfoot” and act
accordingly. For the average sportsman the
object of a hunting trip in the West is to
obtain diversion and acquire health. All the
roughing it one requires is the vigorous exercise,
the fresh air, with an occasional dip in
ice cold water, which is conducive to health;
the rest of the hardship it is well to leave out
as far as possible.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">VIEW FROM MT. LEIDY.</p></div>

<p>My experience has led me to add to a
hunting outfit, the oftener I go out, rather
than depleting it. The first time I really saw
an up-to-date outfit was in 1902, when I
engaged as my guide Edward Sheffield, of
Idaho. I joked him about all the things he
was taking along and called him a “tenderfoot.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
He replied that “he had had all the
roughing it he wanted in his time, and those
who really knew what it was generally preferred
a camp as comfortable as possible.”
I experienced during that trip and a subsequent
one I took next fall such comfort,
combined with good sport, as I never had
before.</p>

<p>I would advise taking an emergency
medical case supplied with all the ordinary
remedies. I have known the time when such
a thing has proved extremely useful, and I
have also known of sportsmen who have had
their outing ruined through lack of some
simple remedy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span></p>

<h2 id="AN_ELK_HUNT_IN_WYOMING">AN ELK HUNT IN WYOMING</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">When</span> I wrote to my old guide Edward
Sheffield, I was somewhat apprehensive
about the outlook for sport, because I
had heard that the best part of the Jackson
Hole Country had been included in the
reserve set apart by the State of Wyoming,
where sport with big game had been entirely
interdicted.</p>

<p>I was advised, however, that this was not
the fact, and pinning my faith to the good
judgment of the guide, I made arrangements
for a fall hunt. Before reaching the terminal
of the railroad journey I chanced to meet
some sportsmen who discussed the sport and
commented on the conditions existing in
Jackson’s Hole. The criticisms were by no
means favorable, and various instances were
cited of parties who had been disappointed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
in their expectations. My subsequent experience
only served to convince me how
dependent a sportsman has become upon the
services of a good guide.</p>

<p>The trip from St. Anthony to Jackson was
without incident worth relating, except at
the start. The pack horses, which, during
their stay in town, had fared handsomely on
oats and hay and been well sheltered, did not
look forward to a trip back into the bleak
and sterile mountains with the same pleasure
that I did; their refractory souls yearned for
the comfortable quarters they were just leaving
with the same tenacity that the children
of Israel in the wilderness “longed for the
fleshpots of Egypt,” but here the comparison
ends, for they had not a guide who was
meek and gentle like Moses.</p>

<p>About a mile from St. Anthony the whole
bunch turned off on a side road and went
back to their former quarters. After some
delay they were finally got in line again, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
with the aid of a couple of Mormons, who,
for a consideration, agreed to help them
for several miles, we got the pack train
properly started, and after that had no
further trouble with them.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i145" src="images/i145.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">GUIDE EDWARD SHEFFIELD AND TWO ELK HEADS.</p></div>

<p>The journey was a fairly long one, but it
became more interesting as we drew away
from civilization and got closer to the place
where we intended to make permanent camp.
After the first day we passed the wide
monotonous stretch of sage brush flats which
lies between St. Anthony and Victor; after
that the landscape grew more mountainous
and wooded. The country became very picturesque
as we proceeded; every mountain
presented a view which was a panorama;
every opening in the timber seemed a natural
frame for an entrancing picture; the atmosphere
so clear and bracing gave fine definition
to objects in view; the winding river rushed
fretting and foaming between the rocks in
the valley below; large clumps of spruces
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
clustered upon the mountain sides, and the
rough crags were powdered with snow and
sometimes glistening with rills which coursed
down their rugged surfaces. After traveling
along the Gros Ventre River for a considerable
distance we at last came in view of Mt.
Leidy, superbly situated between two rows
of mountains on either side of a pleasant
valley, at the head of which that peak
stands. The ground was covered with a few
inches of snow&mdash;enough to make good hunting.
We made an early camp and had plenty
of time to get everything arranged before it
became dark. The location was ideal; plenty
of timber nearby; a fine stream of clear, cold
water, and good grazing for the horses. It
was quite important to have a good range
for the stock, because there were eleven pack
horses and three riding horses&mdash;fourteen in
all. To take care of these required the services
of a horse wrangler. I had three men,
my regular guide, Edward Sheffield; Charles
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
Herdick, a Wyoming guide, and Marcus Imo,
who cooked and turned his hand to anything
else that had to be attended to.</p>

<p>The day being young when we arrived,
I employed it in making a short hunting
scout. Charles Herdick went with me, and
I soon discovered how much my wind had
deteriorated since I had last been out, for
in the meantime I had lived a life of comparative
ease. The general elevation in this
section ranges from 7,000 to 10,000 feet,
and it takes a few days to accustom your
lungs to the rarified atmosphere. When one
is not taking any vigorous exercise the climate
feels exhilarating and inspires one with the
belief that he is able to perform any kind
of feat; a few minutes of real strenuous
exercise and this delusion is destroyed. I
soon discovered that Herdick was a good
hand at mountain climbing, being wonderfully
supple and possessed of the best pair
of lungs of anyone I ever knew.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span></p>

<p>We finally caught sight of a small bunch
of elk at a considerable distance. As they
were moving over a crest of a hill it became
necessary to travel with speed to get near
enough for a shot, if by chance there should
be a good head in the bunch. The elk had
not seen us, but were moving and might get
out of range. Completely exhausted I finally
gained the summit of a hill overlooking
the herd, which had halted. An old bull
stood in the quaking aspens, not over sixty
yards away. A glance at the head, and I
saw that I had had my pains for nothing. I
watched the animals for a few moments, and
they seemed to me like old acquaintances, for
it had been three years since I last hunted
this kind of game. I do not believe they
were as pleased to see me as I was to see
them. They soon started to run directly from
us in the direction of camp, which was quite
near. My guide, Edward Sheffield, told me
afterward that they came very near, and he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
was afraid they would run through camp.
He gravely warned me against the danger
of driving a large bunch of “Uncle Sam’s
cattle” in that direction.</p>

<p>It was a pleasure after this little excitement
to drop into a comfortable camp and
find everything nicely arranged and a good
meal provided. My quarters were supplied
with every convenience that could be expected
by one who travels with a pack outfit.
It may, perhaps, interest those who have had
no practical experience in Western hunting
to know what can be furnished. We had
folding chairs, a folding table, two tents, and
in each a portable sheet-iron stove with a
couple of lengths of pipe to take off the
smoke. I had a pneumatic mattress to save
my tired flesh from the hard ground, and
whatever else was required which horses
could pack in. When I was tired of hunting
I could rest a day or so and read novels in
a comfortable tent, no matter how cold the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
weather. This does not seem like roughing
it. The frontiersman of former days would
have thought such comfort with a hunting
outfit impossible. Modern progress, however,
has caused most of the inconveniences
of camp life to disappear as if by magic.
Would that its magic influence could restock
the wilderness with the great herds of wild
animals that have vanished.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i150" src="images/i150.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">VALLEY OF GROS VENTRE.</p></div>

<p>The following day I went out with the
guide to try my luck. We had not traveled
more than two miles before discovering a
small herd of elk. We circled around them
sufficiently to size them up, but could find no
heads worth picking out. Our course was
then changed, and we hunted toward a high
mountain north of Mt. Leidy. From this
point we obtained a fine view of the surrounding
country, which I carefully swept
with my Seitz glasses in quest of game. Far
off on a distant ridge we finally saw some
elk slowly moving out of the timber into the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
open. Their brown shapes showed very
distinctly against the snow-covered hills, but,
although there was a considerable number in
view, no good antlers were visible. My
strong glasses proved of very great service
to me. With them I could ascertain plainly
what otherwise I would have had to guess
at, and they saved me many a long excursion
over rough country to determine the value
of a set of antlers. My guide was quite as
anxious as myself that I should not have any
trophies unworthy of a sportsman’s ambition.
The law allows one only two heads, and it
is necessary to take great pains to avoid
making mistakes. I made up my mind that
I would go back empty-handed rather than
pack out antlers which would reflect discredit
upon my skill. The guide was particularly
anxious that I should obtain specimens which
would do no injury to his reputation. I
think I must have passed unfavorable judgment
upon twenty-five or thirty heads&mdash;for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
which the guide was mainly responsible&mdash;before
I finally secured my trophies. Any
number of bulls presented themselves, some
of them quite easy marks, only to be snubbed
and turned down. Paris, in passing judgment
upon the goddesses to determine which
was the most beautiful, could not have been
more critical or discriminating than the guide.
I doubt if the unsuccessful rivals of the bulls
I finally chose as worthy specimens were
seriously disappointed.</p>

<p>To illustrate the ease with which I could
have secured my legal allowance of two bulls,
to say nothing of cows, I will cite a few instances
of the opportunities I had. On one
occasion I was going through the timber
where I heard a number of elk. The guide
called my attention to a bull lying on the
ground not sixty yards away, partly concealed
by the spruce brush. He was facing
directly toward us, his front feet folded
under his body and his nose close to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
ground. We stood quite still and surveyed
him carefully, sizing up the head, which had
twelve points, but not large nor heavy at the
base. The glasses were brought into service
to make a more critical examination. A
couple of minutes we stood discussing him,
when finally he gave a brief snort, which
sounded like an expression of disgust at our
impertinence, and then jumped up and loped
out of sight.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward we managed to approach
close to a very large herd of elk, mostly
hidden in the timber. From our concealment
we could see a number of the animals not
over thirty or forty yards away. About 150
yards off were a couple of young bulls exercising
their skill by fencing with their antlers,
evidently in sport. We could hear the frequent
clash of the horns and often got a good
view of the contestants. We waited in this
spot over an hour, until despairing of seeing
anything worth shooting at before it grew
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
too dark, we suddenly rose up in plain view.
The peaceful scene was soon converted into
one of great confusion. For a moment the
elk stared at us with their beautiful large
brown eyes in astonishment, then a general
panic communicated itself to the herd, and
every animal in sight began moving off. Each
clump of vegetation that could conceal a
form seemed suddenly animated by a creature
breaking from its hiding place, fleeing for
safety; the cows and calves gave vent to their
peculiar bleat of alarm, while the bulls
snorted and rattled their antlers against the
trees in their haste. For some hundred yards
in the timber, and well up on the mountain
side, the scene became particularly animated.
I hurried to an opening in the timber, where
I could get a good view of the retreating
herd, which had drawn together into quite a
solid moving mass. The number of elk
greatly exceeded my expectations. Nine-tenths
of the herd had been as carefully concealed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
from us as we had been from them.
There must have been at a conservative
estimate not less than 400 in the herd, and
possibly 500. A sportsman could only admire
this striking and beautiful spectacle
because there was no head worth securing.
A tooth hunter or a butcher, with a high-power
repeating rifle, could have repeated
one of those scenes which sickens every lover
of sport.</p>

<p>At another time I came upon a band of
elk quite as numerous, and, although there
were a couple of good heads in view, yet the
number of cow elk was so great that it was
practically impossible to get a good shot.
The entire mass fled straight up the side of
a steep mountain covered with quaking aspen
and spruce. For some time we could see
them crowding one another in dense masses
in their ascent, but the only shot attempted
was with the camera, and without success.</p>

<p>One more instance, which will not only aid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
in proving the ease of securing an indifferent
specimen, but goes to show that when game
is too plentiful it is an actual handicap to
the sportsman. I saw a fine head across a
gulch at a considerable distance. I fired and
missed it and the animal escaped beyond
range. I crossed the gulch to examine the
spot where the bull had stood and followed
his tracks to see if he had been wounded, and
if so, how badly. Although the ground was
covered with two feet of snow, yet I could
discover no signs of blood. While discussing
the matter with the guide we became conscious
that we were not unperceived, for a
great number of elk began to move among
the trees, having evidently “spotted” us. We
made at once for concealment and ran as fast
as we could through the deep snow to an
open place toward which the herd was heading.</p>

<p>Carefully hidden from view we saw a
great brown mass thunder past, and before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
it had disappeared from sight I caught a
glimpse of the precious set of antlers belonging
to the bull I shot at carried in triumph
out of sight. They appeared but for a
moment in the narrow opening, in which the
intended victim was well protected by cows,
which formed a perfect wall of flesh which
no bullet could pierce and speed on to its
mark. We made another run under concealment
in the hope of being able to come upon
the herd again in case it should halt, which
it did. In an open space on the further side
of the mountain we confronted the elk at
close quarters. The rapid traveling in the
deep snow over rough country left me very
much exhausted. The first object that
attracted the attention of the guide and myself
was a large bull of twelve points at very
close range. I thought in the hurry of the
moment, my vision perhaps being blurred by
nervous strain and exhaustion, that it was the
same magnificent specimen I had shot at before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
and was trying to secure, and the
animal’s position&mdash;turned quartering toward
me&mdash;aided the deception. I soon discovered
the mistake, however, my attention being
called by the guide to another bull which
proved to be the one I so earnestly desired.
I brought my rifle in position to draw a bead
on a vital spot, but the bull was immediately
blanketed by several cows running between.
If I could have had a clear range the shot
would have been about the easiest I ever had,
but the faithful cows with their calves
swarmed around their lord, and I beheld with
disappointment as fine a pair of antlers as
I ever saw borne safely out of sight. The
old bull must have evidently believed that
“there is safety in numbers.”</p>

<p>There is another disadvantage in encountering
a great quantity of game when attempting
to secure a good trophy. Each animal,
however poor a head it may possess, has
generally a good pair of eyes, a keen scent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
and excellent hearing. Each addition to a
herd is another sentinel, always on duty and
ready at any moment to sound the alarm.
On a previous hunting trip, when the elk
were not nearly so plentiful, I got the heads
I wanted in less time. I cannot place the
blame for the trouble I had in securing my
heads on the cows entirely.</p>

<p>A couple of days before the scarlet letter
day of my hunt I fired at a fine bull in a gulch
quite a distance off. He immediately quickened
his pace and was soon out of range. I
glanced at my rifle and I found that the
elevation of the sight had been misplaced,
being ranged for fifty yards. I think it is
best to have the sight of a high power gun
with a very flat trajectory sighted for 100
yards, and to draw a fine or coarse sight on
the object as occasion may require. We examined
the spot where the bull had been
seen when fired at and discovered a sprinkling
of blood along his tracks. Tying the horses,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
we started to follow the trail on foot. The
course the bull took favored the higher elevations
more than the depressions, which was a
bad sign, so with grave misgivings we continued
the pursuit. The increasing signs of
blood inspired us with hope; here and there
he occasionally stood, as was evident from
the quantity of blood and the character of
the impression his feet made in the snow.
In other respects the signs were disappointing;
the tracks showed no indication of weakness,
and frequently led us across high fallen
trees and along steep places, where I followed
with difficulty. The blood, although
quite plentiful, was a light red, and not the
dark color which would be discharged were
some vital spot injured. Finally, after traveling
about six miles, the flow of blood began
to lessen. At length we reached a point
where he entered a tract of thick timber,
evidently at a walk. We concluded that it
was best not to pursue him in this retreat,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
because his slow pace might indicate exhaustion
and a disposition to lie down. The only
hope I had of securing him would be in case
of his lying down and becoming stiff from
his wound and not being able to get up. We
concluded to allow plenty of time for this to
happen. The guide made a circuit around
the timber and could discover no trace of his
having emerged from it. We then went
back to the horses and rode to camp. The
succeeding day we returned to the spot,
traced the steps of the elk to a place where
he had lain down, and saw a slight discoloration
of the snow where his brisket had
touched it, his tracks led onward, and signs
of bleeding had ceased. All our trouble had
been in vain because of an improperly arranged
sight.</p>

<p class="caption">CHAS. HERDICK SKINNING A BULL ELK.
THE AUTHOR AT THE RIGHT.</p></div>

<p>By this time I had been about ten days in
camp and was growing quite accustomed to
the life. Although the weather was quite
cold, at times going to eight or ten below
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
zero at night, yet it often grew warm enough
during the day to thaw, but it was dry, light
atmosphere and always bracing. Every night
for a brief interval we were treated to a
serenade from the coyotes, a ridiculous, wild
and unearthly chant, which became a positive
nuisance when the dogs undertook an accompaniment
right at our ears. Occasionally a
bull elk, feeding during the full of the moon,
would cause the cold atmosphere to vibrate
with his shrill whistle as he loped past the
camp. In all other respects we were entirely
alone for the twenty-two days I stayed in
camp except one, when the game warden
dropped in to look at my license, and after
a brief stay took his departure. How different
this was from most of the hunting in
the East, where the number of sportsmen
has become so great as to render the pastime
almost as dangerous for the hunter as it is
for game. Particularly is this the case when
“green sportsmen” persist in shooting at anything
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
that moves without first finding out
what it is. My guide expressed his surprise
at the number of accidents which occur every
year in the Adirondacks through gross carelessness.
He remarked that he believed it
would be best if one were hunting in the
Adirondacks and saw anything moving in the
brush to shoot without waiting to find out
what it was, because the chances are that it
would be a man, and if you did not shoot
him he would shoot you. I was rather
amused at this piece of grim humor, which is
a sample of what he generally had on tap.</p>

<p>The sun dawned auspiciously upon what
proved to be my luckiest day in camp. For
some days I had hunted diligently without
securing the heads that would satisfy me.
We had not journeyed over three miles from
camp before we saw, at quite a distance, a
large bull move into a thickly wooded valley.
We turned our course in that direction, keeping
out of view as much as possible, riding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
along a hill which overlooked the valley into
which the bull had taken refuge. We came
to an open and slightly undulating country,
which was covered with about eighteen inches
of snow, and gave evidence that quite a
number of elk had recently passed that way,
and about 500 yards off saw a herd with several
good heads. The country was quite open,
but broken up with thick clumps of spruce
trees here and there. To get nearer the herd
it was necessary to cross a wide open space,
but by a timely maneuver of the guide
we traveled under cover until we reached a
point where a thick clump of trees standing
out in the open space obstructed the view
between us and the elk. We then rode out
in the open toward the clump of trees
which concealed us from view. Having
gained this point, which was about 175 to
200 yards from the herd, I dismounted and
stepped out in the clearing. The cows again
provokingly ran between me and the largest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
bull, which I had marked as my own. Fortunately,
the cows ran ahead and I got a
quartering view of the large bull. The
bright reflection of the sun on the snow made
it somewhat difficult to fully distinguish the
body of the animal in the dense moving mass,
but I succeeded in locating it. Drawing a
fine sight on my Mauser I fired. The entire
herd disappeared over the crest of the hill.
The guide, who by this time had mounted
his horse, cried, “You have got a bull.” I
asked him if it was the “big one.” He replied,
“I don’t know.” In the confused and
changing mass it was indeed difficult to keep
track of any particular one. We urged the
horses to their utmost speed; the antlers of
the bull continued growing larger to the view
as we drew near. Finally, with an exclamation
of satisfaction, the guide slipped off his
horse and congratulated me upon the kill.
“The largest head in the bunch.” It was
indeed a fine bull, with a spread just short
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
of four feet. There were twelve points on
the antlers, six tines on each side. The bullet
had lodged a little back of the shoulder and
the animal had dropped without a struggle.
In the space of fifteen or twenty minutes the
carcass was dressed; the mantle had been
stripped off, and we were ready to return for
a couple of pack horses to bring in the antlers
and meat.</p>

<p>We had hardly mounted the horses when
we saw another bull with a fine head about
250 yards away. I slid off my horse, and
getting the distance from the guide, I drew
a coarse sight and fired as the animal was
going over a hill. We hurried over to the
spot where the bull had been and saw faint
splotches of blood on the snow. As we
descended the hill the guide remarked he
hoped we would not have as long a chase
after this one as we did after the bull we
hunted so long a few days previous. I replied
that I was certain we would not. “How
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
do you know?” he asked. For answer I
pointed to a lifeless form just beyond lying
among some spruce trees. As the guide
stepped alongside of me, where he could get
a view, he expressed his surprise at the luck
I had had in getting two such fine heads in
so short an interval. It was barely half an
hour since I had secured my first trophy, and
now I had a second one which we both regarded
as better than the first. The ball had
struck back of the shoulder a little above the
middle of the body. The spread of this head
was a trifle larger than the first one I had
shot; the antlers were more solid, especially
at the base. My hard hunting had been rewarded.
I had obtained inside of half an
hour two heads as handsome and large as
any that it had ever been my good fortune
to secure. I felt like a school boy about to
take a vacation, for I had hunted faithfully
for about eleven days and I promised myself
a rest when I had won out with the bulls.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span></p>

<p>For several days I took it easy; a large
part of the time I sat in a comfortable chair
in camp and read novels and played cards.
I also managed to work up quite a small
medical practice, my victims being Sheffield,
Charles Herdick and Marcus Imo, the cock
and horse wrangler. The remedies which
some people of the far West prescribe for
their ailments are quite original and simple.
One day when I was starting out on horseback
to hunt in company with Herdick, I
noticed that he had not saddled his horse.
I asked him the reason. He replied that he
was not feeling well and wanted exercise.
Anyone familiar with hunting in Jackson’s
Hole knows how often one has to leave the
horse to travel on foot over rough country
through snow and up slippery ascents for
hundreds of feet.</p>

<p>Herdick evidently thought this was not
enough exercise to keep him in condition.
Another time Imo had contracted a severe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
cold which I wanted to prescribe for. He
replied that it had come on without anything
and it would go off without anything. After
some persuasion he consented to take a good
dose of quinine and a hot drink before retiring.
The next morning the cold had about
disappeared, but when Imo went out to
round up the horses he had great difficulty
in hearing the bell on account of the quinine
buzzing in his ear, which confirmed his bad
opinion of medicine.</p>

<p>After I had tired of loafing I hunted with
the dogs, tracking cougars, bobcats and lynx.
Occasionally I would take a shot at a coyote
to pay it back for some of the unearthly
serenades we had been treated to at night.
One day, while following the track of a lynx,
Herdick came across a No. 5 bear trap. He
discovered it by noticing some fresh elk meat
near it. The trap was carefully concealed,
and had he been an inexperienced hunter or
perhaps walking along there at night he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
might have made discovery by stepping in it.
It is against the law to bait a trap with elk
meat, and it should be forbidden to set traps
around indiscriminately where sportsmen are
licensed to hunt; the permission implying
reasonable safety, which is not the case when
dangerous traps are set without proper safeguards.
We sprung the trap and went on.
Some men, who are acquainted with the
danger arising from this source, always carry
a monkey-wrench when hunting or trapping.
A steel trap which could hold a silver-tip
would inflict a terrible injury upon anyone
who was unfortunate enough to become entrapped,
even if assistance were promptly
rendered, and assistance being remote, might
cause a painful, lingering death. I knew of
a case where a trapper had set two No. 5
bear traps, and upon his return found a large
silver-tip in one of them. Venturing rather
close to the bear the enraged animal made a
sudden lunge at him, which the man evaded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
by stepping back hurriedly. In doing so he
accidentally fell and sprung the other trap
with his knee and was caught in that position.
The man was unable to get to his rifle to
dispatch the bear, which was making efforts
to reach him. Being in uncomfortably close
quarters to the bear, and apprehensive of his
safety, the trapper devised a clever plan to
dispose of his disagreeable neighbor. Fastening
his knife to the end of a long pole he
repeatedly stabbed the bear until death ensued.
His companion, going to examine the
traps, at last found him almost dead with
pain and released him.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i171" src="images/i171.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">GROS VENTRE RIVER.</p></div>

<p>The end of my outing at length drew
near, and it became necessary to make
arrangements to break camp. I had become
quite attached to the beautiful spot where I
had spent such a pleasant time and had so
much luck. Although I had not bagged all
the game the law allowed me, yet I felt that
I had obtained exceptionally good heads and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
was satisfied. I had also collected a considerable
number of photographs, of which
Sheffield took the greatest number; in fact,
he proved quite an expert in this line. The
horses seemed no more anxious to leave than
we were, and occasionally proved refractory
and commenced to buck until something was
bound over their eyes. The first night of the
journey homeward we camped on the banks
of the Gros Ventre. We put up no tents, but
slept out in the open, because, as I said to
the guide, I wanted to see how it felt to rough
it.</p>

<p>During the day we had descended into
a country where the elevation was considerably
lower. The snow, which we had seen
continuously in our former camp, had all
disappeared and the temperature was much
warmer. Early the next day we reached
Jackson, where we put up at Nelson’s
Hotel and were very hospitably entertained.
Although remote from the regular line of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
travel and the railroad, the people in this
locality live remarkably well and in comfort,
and on reaching this point I felt I was in
touch with the rest of the world. Although
it is 100 miles from the railroad, yet it is
connected with St. Anthony by telephone. A
musical entertainment was arranged here for
our benefit by the hospitable inhabitants of
the place, which proved very enjoyable.</p>

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
